<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Reading information from files is a common and important operation in Python. In
this lecture we will discuss various options for reading files, and characterize
them based on simplicity and efficiency (mostly with regards to efficiency in
the use of space/memory, which is important when reading very large files).

In a nutshell, you should avoid the use of the .read() and .readlines() methods
and instead iterate over files (using a standard for loop or a for loop in a
comprehension).

The last section defines the parse_line function (available in the goody module)
and how to use it, making reading files that contain multi-type records (fields
of values) easy. One parameter binds to a tuple/list of function objects, each
specifying how to convert the field in its position (a substring of each line)
into a value of the appropriate type.
</pre>

<a name="simple"><h1>Simple and Space Efficient Code</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
To start, let's suppose we are reading a file where each line in the file is
just a string of text. The simplest and most efficient way to read such a file
is iterating over an "open" (file) object.

  for line in open(file_name):  # where file_name is a string naming a file
      process(line)             # where process is a function or some code block

Typically, we need to strip off the newline character(s) at the end of each line
as it is read from the file, before it is processed further. We can strip off
this information by calling .rstrip('\n'). The code would become

for line in open(file_name):
    process(line.rstrip('\n'))

or

for line in open(file_name):
    line = line.rstrip('\n')
    process(line)

  Technically the os module binds the name linesep to the character(s) forming
  a newline on that operating system. For PCs os.linesep is '\r\n'; on Macs it
  is '\n'. So, we could call .rstrip(os.linesep) on the line. But when we read
  a line from a text file in Python, it converts any newline character(s) to
  just the single character '\n', regardless of the operating system. This
  makes it easier to write Python code that works on all operating systems.

Note that if we call .rstrip() with no arguments, all white-space characters
(including the newline character(s), spaces, and tabs) are stripped. We can use
this simpler alternative if we don't meaningfully process whitespace at the ends
of lines, but if we need to preserve it, we must call rstrip('\n'). 

Recall that there are NO MUTATOR methods on strings: so, when we call the
line.rstrip(...) method, it does not mutate the object associated with line, but
instead it produces a new string that has the same contents except with the
requested character(s) stripped off its right end; we pass this new string as
an argument to the process function, or rebind line to that new string.

So, the left code is correctly by the right code is INCORRECT

  for line in open(file_name): 	      	   for line in open(file_name):
      line = line.rstrip('\n')		       line.rstrip('\n') # does NOTHING!
      process(line)			       process(line)

The for loops in the code fragments above are all space efficient, because at
any time Python stores only one line of the file in memory (although the file
itself is likely cached/stored in a memory buffer). Note that if we wanted to
create a list of lines read from the file (where the newline character(s) are
removed from each string), we can write the following simple comprehension.

line_list = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(file_name)]

Note that in this example, line_list occupies about the same amount of space as
the file: all lines are stored in memory (one per list entry) at the same time.
If we can process lines independently of each other (process each one without
know the previous or subsequent lines) we should NOT write code to store a list
of all the lines, because it is not space efficient.

Finally, in ICS-32 you learned (if you are reading this in ICS-33)/will learn
(if you are reading this in ICS-31) that we can use open as a context manager in
a with statement, which handles file exceptions and automatically closes the
file when the context manager finishes (which is often useful/important, but
not always). With the open context manager, we would write the above code
fragments as

with open(file_name) as open_file:
    for line in open_file:
        process(line.rstrip('\n'))

or

with open(file_name) as open_file:
    line_list = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(open_file)]

Using context managers does not change the space efficiency of the file reading.

<a name="read"><h1>The .readlines() and .read() methods</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We can apply the .readlines() method to an open file: it produces a list of all
the lines in the file, where each line still ends in the newline character '\n'.

So, if open_file refers to the following open file,

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3

calling open_file.readlines() returns the list

['Line 1\n', 'Line 2\n', Line 3\n']

If we wanted to call .readlines() and process every string in the file (without
the '\n' characters at the end) we would write 

for line in open(file_name).readlines():
    process(line.rstrip('\n'))

Notice that this code is longer than the loop given in the previous section,
and is less space efficient, because it first computes a list of all the lines
in the file, storing it in memory at one time, and then it iterates over the
strings in that list; the loop in the previous section stores in memory only
one line at a time of the file, while it process that line.

If we wanted to create a list of lines without the '\n' characters at the end,
we could write 

line_list = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(file_name).readlines()]

which is similar to but also more complicated than the code in the previous
section.

Finally, if we wanted to compute a list of lines WITH the '\n' characters at
the end, then calling

line_list = open(file_name).readlines()

which is simpler than the comprehension code below

line_list = [line for line in open(file_name)]

and does occupy the equivalent amount of storage. So this is one of the few
places (and not really common) where calling the .readlines() method is useful.

----------

We can apply the .read() method to an open file: it produces one giant string
that contains all the lines in the file, each ended by the newline character
'\n'.

So, if open_file refers to the following open file,

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3

calling open_file.read() returns the string

'Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\n'

We can split this string into a list of strings by calling the .split method.

line_list = open(file_name).read().split('\n')

and this code is simpler than what we have seen before, which is equivalent to

line_list = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(file_name)]

The .read() code above is a bit less space efficient than the comprehension,
because it stores both the entire file string and a list of all the lines in
the file at the same time; the comprehension stores the list of all the lines
in the file, but not a string whose contents is the entire file itself.

Likewise, if we wanted to process every string in the file (without the '\n'
characters at the ends) we can write 

for line in open(file_name).read().split('\n'):
    process(line)

The for loop code is more complicated than the loop in the previous section, and
it uses space much less efficiently: this code stores the entire file (and a
list of lines in the file) in memory at one time; the loop in the previous
section stores in memory only one line at a time of the file. Not that because
of the call to split after read, there is no need for a call to split inside the
loop.

Bottom Line:

There is little to be gained by reading files by calling the .readline() and the
.read() method. Iterate directly over the "open" file with a standard for loop
or a for loop in a comprehension.

<a name="parse"><h1>Reading Files and Parsing</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Some text files contain lines that store other types or mixed-types of
information. Suppose that we wanted to read a text file that stored strings
representing numbers (one number per line). We can easily rewrite our original
code to the following, calling the int conversion function on each rstripped
line.

for line in open(file_name):
    process( int(line.rstrip('\n')) )

Here we are assuming process takes an integer value as an argument.

In some files each line is a "record": a fixed number of fields of values, with
possibly different types, separated by some special character (often a space or
punctuation character like a comma or colon). To process each record in a file,
we must 

  (1) read its line
  (2) separate its fields of values (still each value is a string)
  (3) call a conversion function for each string to get its value

The goody module contains the parse_lines function (technically a generator,
which we will study in ICS-33) that easily supports reading records from files
(similarly to how lines are read from "open" files).

def parse_lines(open_file, sep, conversions):
    for line in open_file:
        yield [conv(item) for conv,item in
                  zip(conversions,line.strip('\n').split(sep))]

Here sep is a special character used to separate the fields in the record;
conversions is a tuple (or list) of function objects: they are applied in
sequence to the string values of the separated fields. When we iterate over a
call to parse_lines (simlar to iterating over a call to "open"), the index
variable is bound to a list of the values of the fields in the record.

For example, the following file contains fields of a name (str) followed by two
test scores (ints) all separated by commas.

Bob Smith,75,80
Mary Jones,85,90

We could read this file and print out the names of each student and their
average test score by

for fields in parse_lines( open(file_name), ',' , (str,int,int) ):
  print(fields[0], (fields[1]+fields[2])/2)

Here fields is repeatedly bound to a 3-list containing a name (str) followed
by two test scores (ints). fields is first bound to ['Bob Smith', 75, 80] and
then to ['Mary Jones', 85, 90]. 

-----
1) Note that if we specified conversions as (str,int) it would return the
2-lists ['Bob Smith', 75] followed by ['Mary Jones', 85] (because looping over
a zip stops when one of its arguments runs out of values: here each line
contains more field values than conversion functions).  Accessing fields[2]
in the code above would raise an IndexError exception.

2) Likewise (because looping over a zip stops when one of its arguments runs
out of values), if the a line contains a name and 3 integer values, only the
name and first two integers would be returned in the 3-list: the line

Paul White,80,75,85

returns only the 3-list ['Paul White', 80, 75]

So parse_lines would not raise any exceptions in the code above.

We could define a more complicated parse_lines function that checked and
immediately raised an exception if the number of separated field values in a
record was not equal to the length of the tuple of conversion functions.
-----

A simpler way to write such code is to use multiple index variables and 
unpacking (as we do when we write: for k,v in adict.items()).

for name,test1,test2 in parse_lines(open(file_name),',',(str,int,int)):
  print(name, (test1+test2)/2)

With this for loop, the first error noted above would also raise an exception
because there would not be three values to unpack into name, test1, and test2;
the second error would again go unnoticed.

Finally, note that besides using the standard conversion function(s) like str
and int, we can define our own conversion function(s). For example, suppose that
each record in the file specified a string name, some number of 
int quiz results separated by colons, and an int final exam, with these three
fields (name, quizzes, final) separated by commas. Such a file might look like

Bob Smith,75:80,90
Mary Jones,85:90:77,85

Here Bob took two quizzes but Mary took three. We could define

def quiz_list(scores):
    return [int(q) for q in scores.split(':')]

and then write

for name,quizzes,final in parse_lines(open(file_name),',',(str,quiz_list,int)):
  print(name, sum(quizzes)/len(quizzes), final)

which would print

Bob Smith 77.5 90
Mary Jones 84.0 85

Note that 77.5 is (75+90)/2 and 84 is (85+90+77)/3. If we instead wrote

for fields in parse_lines(open(file_name),',',(str,quiz_list,int)):
  print(fields)

it would print the 3-lists

['Bob Smith', [75, 80], 90]
['Mary Jones', [85, 90, 77], 85]

Of course, we can also use lambdas instead of named functions; below we have
substituted a lambda for the quiz_list function.

for fields in parse_lines(open(file_name),',',
                          (str,
                           lambda scores : [int(q) for q in scores.split(':')],
                           int)):
  print(fields)

<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Suppose that we want to process the lower case version of every word on
every line (where the words on a line are separated by colons) in a file named
file.txt. Which of the following code fragments correctly does so? For those
that don't, explain why they fail. For example, if the file contained the three
lines:

  See spot
  See spot run
  Run spot run

it should process the following words in the following order:
  'see', 'spot', 'see', 'spot', 'run', 'run', 'spot', 'run'.

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.rstrip().lower().split():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.rstrip().split().lower():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.lower().rstrip().split():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.lower().split().rstrip():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.split().rstrip().lower():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt'):
    for word in line.split().lower().rstrip():
        process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt').read().lower().split('\n'):
    process(word)  

for line in open('file.txt').read().split('\n').lower():
    process(word)
