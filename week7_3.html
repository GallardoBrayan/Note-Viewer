<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this lecture we will look at a few useful examples of inheritance,
classifying them into two categories: normal and mix-in inheritance. In normal
inheritance, a complicated class is specialized to perform a bit differently:
it typically involves a small derived class single-inheriting from a large base
class. Mix-in inheritance typically involves a large derived class
multiply-inheriting -to add many small special behaviors to it- from a variety
of small base classes.
</pre>

<a name="example"><h1>Normal Inheritance Examples</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
pdefaultdict derived from the base-class dict:

The dict class implements a standard Python dictionary. It is a large class that
defines many methods. In this example we will use it as a base class, deriving
from it (using single-inheritance) the defaultdict class. Actually defaultdict
is already defined in the collections module, so here we will define the
pdefaultdict (pseudo-defaultdict) class in the pcollection (pseudo-collections)
module.

A defaultdict is a slight variant of a dict, so it is a good candidate to
define via inheritance. All operators/methods working on dicts make sense
working on defaultdicts; most work correctly purely by inheritance, but we must
change the parmeters of the __init__ method, and override the meanings of the
__repr__  and __missing__ methods.

A defaultdict has only three behavioral differences from a dict:

(1) Its __init__ method can/should be initialized with a special reference to a
class/function that called (without parameters) to store/return values for any
missing key.

(2) Its __repr__ method returns a string with 'defaultdict' followed, in
parentheses, by the special reference to a class/function passed to __init__
followed by the key:value items in the dictionary.

(3) When a key that is missing from the defaultdict is referred to, the key is
automatically added to the defaultdict, associated with the value returned by
calling (with no arguments) the special reference to a class/function passed to
__init__. Note that the method __missing__ is already called in such
circumstances (in dict, callig __missing__ raises a KeyError exception), so we
will override this method in the derived/defaultdict class to perform these
actions.

Here is a complete definition of pdefaultdict derived from dict.

class pdefaultdict(dict):
    def __init__(self,default_factory=None,initial_dict=[],**kargs):
        dict.__init__(self,initial_dict,**kargs)  # use to initialize base-class
        self._default_factory = default_factory   # use in overridden methods
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'pdefaultdict('+str(self._default_factory)+','+dict.__repr__(self)+')'

    # When accessing d[key] the inherited method __getitem__ is
    #   called; if it finds key is not in the dictionary, it calls
    #   self.__missing__(key), returns the result of executing this
    #   method, which uses default_factory, if present, to create a
    #   value assocaited with d[key] and return that value
    def __missing__(self,key):
        if self._default_factory == None:
            raise KeyError(str(key))
        result    = self._default_factory()  # Call it, with no arguments
        self[key] = result
        return result

x = pdefaultdict(list)
x['a'].append('x')
print(x)

prints

pdefaultdict(<class 'list'>,{'a': ['x']})


Notes:

  (1) The standard dict.__init__ method has default-value parameters (a) an
  iterable of items to pre-load the dictionary and (b) any number of item
  parameters of the form key=value (collected in **kargs and added to the
  dictionary after the pre-loaded items).

  The pdefaultdict.__init__ method also has an extra default_factory
  parameter: it uses its second two parameters to call dict.__init__ and then
  also stores default_factory as an attribute the newly constructed pdefauldict
  object, where it is used in the overridden methods __repr__ and __missing___.

  (2) The pdefaultdict.__repr__ method returns the appropriate string, including
  the name 'pdefaultdict', the special reference to a class/function to call
  for missing keys, and the current contents of the dictionary . Of special
  interest is that fact that there is an  explicit call to dict.__repr__(self)
  in this method, which overrides __repr__.

  (3) The pdefaultdict.__missing__ method supplies the difference in meaning
   between dicts and defaultdicts, by overriding the dict.__missing__ method
  (which always raises KeyError): here, so long as self.default_factory is not
   None (typically meaning it has been supplied as an argument to __init__), it
   is called to produce an initial value to associate with the missing key.

  (4) Any other operator/method applied to a defaultdict object executes the
  corresponding method inherited from dict.

----------

Lists indexes starting at 1:

The list class implements a standard Python dictionary. It is a large class that
defines many methods. In this example we will use it as a base class, deriving
the class list1, which represents a list that we index starting at 1. Notice
that it inherits from list (so all the list functions like .append and .sort
work for list1) and overrides __getitem__ to
call list's __getitem__ with a value one smaller. There are a few weird cases
where list1 doesn't quite perform as expected, but for most it does.

from goody import irange

class list1(list):
    # Handle positive and negative indexes correctly
    def __getitem__(self,index):
        return list.__getitem__(self, index-1 if index > 0 else index)

    def __setitem__(self,index,value):
        list.__setitem__(self, index-1 if index > 0 else index, value)

    def __delitem__(self,index):
        list.__delitem__(self, index-1 if index > 0 else index)
    
    ... other methods too

x = list1([1,2,3,4, 5])
for i in irange(1,len(x)):
    print(i,x[i]) 
    x.append('x')
print(x)
x.reverse()
print(x)
print(2 in x) 

this prints

1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x']
['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
True 

----------

OptionMenuValue derived from the base-class OptionMenu (in tkinter)

The OptionMenu class is defined in the tkinter module. Constructing an
OptionMenu widget in a Frame presents the user with a labeled menu, allowing
the user to see, select, and reselect a desired option, and discover what the
string value of the current selected option is.

The constructor for OptionMenu has an aribitrary number of arguments (see 3).
(1) A parent Frame in which the widget is displayed
(2) A StringVar into which the text of the selection is put.
    When initially displayed, an OptionMenu will show this StingVar's value.
    Clicking it exposes all the other options, which can be selected, replacing
    the value in the StringVar.
(3) Any number of strings which comprise the options for this menu.

Here is a trivial demo tkinter application that illustrates how an OptionMenu is
use, which also uses tkinter's StringVar, Entry, and Button widgets. It displays
an OptionMenu (in column 1) and a Button and Entry (top and bottom in column 2).
The user can select an option from the OptionMenu. The 'Show Chosen Option'
button places the selection into the Entry.

Run this program a few times, repeatedly selecting options and pressing the
'Show Chosen Option' button. Whenever this button is pushed, Python executes the
option_to_entry function (that is the command associated with the button,
wrapped in a parameterless lambda), which erases the information currently in
the Entry e and then puts the text from the StringVar o_var into this Entry.
Note that if no option is chosen yet, the original text in o_var is put in the
Entry.

When pressing the button calls the lambda, its body calls option_to_entry with
the global names o(for the option) and e (for the entry). Using a lambda like
this one is common for commands in tkinter.

-----
commands for widgets (and the partial evaluation alternative)

The command parameter in this button (and other widgets) must refer to a
parameterless function object. Here we use a parameterless lambda that calls the
option_to_entry with the appropriatre argument. Another way to accomplish this
goal is by using partial evaluation, to reduce the number of arguments in the
option_to_entry to 0. After importing partial from functools and defining
option_to_entry, we could add one line and rewrite b = button(...) code.

bs_command = partial(option_to_entry,o_var,e)
b = Button(main,text='Show Chosen Option',command = bs_command)
-----

from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
root.title('Widget Tester')
main = Frame(root)
main.pack(side=TOP,anchor=W)

o_var = StringVar()
o_var.set('Choose Option')
om = OptionMenu(main, o_var, 'option1','option2','option3')
om.grid(row=1,column=1)
om.config(width = 10)

e = Entry(main) 
e.grid(row=2,column=2)

def option_to_entry(option,entry):
    entry.delete(0,END)
    entry.insert(0,option.get())    
b = Button(main,text='Show Chosen Option',command=lambda : option_to_entry(o_var,e))
b.grid(row=1,column=2)

root.mainloop()

This is 18 non-blank lines of code.

Notice that to control the OptionMenu we are required to bind two names: one
for the OptionMenu itself (om) and one to store the value of the chosen option
(o_var). We will now derive a simple variant of OptionMenu, named
OptionMenuValue, which keeps track of its own selection's value. In addition,
we will implement it so that it returns 'None' (rather than the initial value
of o_var, which is the title for the OptionMenu) if the user has made no
selection yet. Finally, a reset method allows us to reset what appears on the
option menu to the string displayed there initially.

As with pdefaultdict/dict or lis1/list, an OptionMenuValue is a slight variant
of an OptionMenu, so it is a good candidate to define via inheritance. All
operators/ methods working on OptionMenu make sense working on OptionMenuValue:
most (e.g. grid and config, called in the code) work purely by inheritance, but
we must change the parameters of the __init__ method and add get/reset methods
in the OptionMenuValue class. Note that there are hundreds of methods that we
can call on most GUI widgets like MenuOption (fore placement, size, etc.)

Observe how the OptionMenuValue class stores and uses its own StringVar, how get
works, and how the option_to_entry function now manipulates the object
constructed from the OptionMenuValue class directly.

from tkinter import *

# OptionMenuValue: with title and option_tuple
# get is a pull function to get the option selected
class OptionMenuValue(OptionMenu):
    def __init__(self,parent,title,*option_tuple,**configs):
        self.result = StringVar()
        self.result.set(title)
        self.original_title = title
        OptionMenu.__init__(self,parent,self.result,*option_tuple,**configs)

    def reset(self):
        self.result.set(self.original_title)
        
    def get(self):
        value = self.result.get()
        return value if value != self.original_title else 'None'


root = Tk()
root.title('Widget Tester')
main = Frame(root)
main.pack(side=TOP,anchor=W)

om = OptionMenuValue(main, 'Choose Option', 'option1','option2','option3')
om.grid(row=1,column=1)
om.config(width = 10)

e = Entry(main) 
e.grid(row=2,column=2)

def option_to_entry(option,entry):
    entry.delete(0,END)
    entry.insert(0,option.get())    
b= Button(main,text='Show Chosen Option',command=lambda : option_to_entry(om,e))
b.grid(row=1,column=2)

b = Button(main,text='Reset Option',command=om.reset)
b.grid(row=1,column=3)

root.mainloop()

Not counting the class definition, this is 18 lines of code, but two are
required to add the new 'Reset Option' button, so the equivalent code has
shrunk from 18 to 16 lines. This reduction isn't tremendous, but most of the
code included does bookkeeping operations. Mostly what we have accomplished is
establishing one object that keepts track of the StringVar functionality inside
the OptionMenuValue object. If we had 10 OptionMenu objects in our program, we
would need 10 StringVar objects too: now we can use just 10 OptionMenuValue
objects (and not have to remember with OptionMenu object goes with which
StringVar object).

----------

OptionMenuToEntry derived from the base-class OptionMenuValue

We will now derive a simple variant of OptionMenuValue named OptionMenuToEntry,
which links to an Entry (see __init__) and updates this Entry automatically
when a new selection is made (indicating it is a new -not yet "gotten with get"-
selection with a green background). When the 'Show Chosen Option' button is
pressed, it shows the option in the Entry (actually, it is already there), but
with a white background. Finally, for this class, reset also puts an empty
string with a white background into the Entry.

As with OptionMenu/OptionMenuValue, an OptionMenuToEntry is a slight variant of
an OptionMenuValue, so it is a good candidate to define via inheritance. All
operators/methods working on OptionMenuValue make sense working on
OptionMenutoEntry: most (e.g. grid, config, get) work purely by inheritance,
but we must change the parameters of the __init__ method, add a put method, and
override the reset method to do something different.

Observe how the OptionMenuToEntry stores and uses its own entry reference,
how reset calls the overridden OptionMenuValue.reset before blanking the Entry,
how put fills the Entry with a green background, and how the command for the
'Show Chosen Entry' button now calls get/put to accomplish its task: we no
longer need the option_to_entry function.

from tkinter import *

# ... define OptionMenuValue class

#OptionMenuToEntry: with title,linked_entry, and option_tuple
#get is an inherited pull function; put is a push function, pushing
#  the selected option into the linked_entry (replacing what is there)
#  with a green backround; reset now resets this text too

class OptionMenuToEntry(OptionMenuValue):
    def __init__(self,parent,title,linked_entry,*option_tuple,**configs):
        self.entry = linked_entry
        OptionMenuValue.__init__(self,parent,title,*option_tuple,command=self.put,**configs)
  
    def reset(self):
        OptionMenuValue.reset(self)
        self.put('','white')
        
    def put(self,option,bg='green'):
        self.entry.delete(0,len(self.entry.get()))
        self.entry.insert(0,option)
        self.entry.config(bg=bg)


root = Tk()
root.title('Widget Tester')
main = Frame(root)
main.pack(side=TOP,anchor=W)

e = Entry(main) 
e.grid(row=2,column=2)

omte = OptionMenuToEntry(main, 'Choose Option', e, 'option1','option2','option3')
omte.grid(row=1,column=1)
omte.config(width = 10)


b= Button(main,text='Show Chosen Option',command=lambda : omte.put(omte.get(),'white'))
b.grid(row=1,column=2)

b = Button(main,text='Reset Option',command=omte.reset)
b.grid(row=1,column=3)

root.mainloop()

Not counting the class definitions, this is 15 lines of code, shrunk from 16
lines.

So, we have seen how we can start with a powerfule class (MenuOption) and easily
specialize it, via inheritance (multiple times), to operate a bit differently.
In this way it is easy to define widgets with exactly the behavior that we need.
It is common to use inheritance when defining/refining advanced GUI widgets.

----------

PrivacyError derived from the base-class Exception 

We have seen that Python defines many exceptions and we have used a variety of
them (either raising them or handling them in except clauses of try/except
statements). We can easily define our own exception classes using inheritance.
In the mix-in inheritance example below, we will refer to PrivacyException,
which is defined as follows.

class PrivacyError(Exception):
    pass # inherits everything (including __init__) and overrides nothing

So here, the whole purpose is to define a class name (which we can name when we
raise an exception, and can name when we handle an exception in a try/except
statements).

In fact, all Exceptions are arranged in an inheritance hierarchy. If we write
"except Foo" in a try/except, it handles a raised exception that is from the
Foo class or any class derived from Foo. Technically, if x refers to an
exception object, it handles any exception class for which isinstance(x,Foo)
is True (recally this means exactly x is an object constructed from the Foo
class or any class derived from Foo.

So we can create a hierarchy of exception classes, some more general (higher
up in the hierarchy, matching more general -many possible- exception classes)
and some more specific (lower in the hierarachy). In a try/except statement
with multiple except parts, the first one matching (by isinstance) executes its
block. So with many except parts, we must order them in such a way that they
are handled correctly (often meaning specific exceptions before general ones). 

For example, there might be a FileError exception for general file errors. We
might define

class InputError (FileError ): ...
class OutputError(FileError ): ...
class EOFError   (InputError): ...

Now if we wrote

except EOFError  :... handles only EOFError

or

except InputError:... handles both InputError and EOFError

or

except FileError :... handles FileError, InputError, OutputError, and EOFError

So writing 

except EOFError  :... one way
except FileError :... another way

would handle EOFError in one way, and all other FileError in another way

Python checks whether the exception object raised is an instance of the
exception named in the except clause. So, for except EOFError, Python checks
whether isintance(raised_exception_object,EOFError).

In fact, we can write a a single class or a tuple/list of classes after the
except keyword. For a single class Python checks whether the exception is an
instance of that class; for a tuple/list it checks whether the exception is an
instance of any class in the list. So

except (InputError,EOFError): ...one way
except OutputError          : ...another one way

would handle inputError and EOFError in one way, and OutputError another way.

<a name="example1"><h1>Mix-in Inheritance Examples</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Now we will switch to a discussion of mix-in inheritance. Typically a mix-in
base class is something small that other classes can be derived from, to
inherit their behavior. For example, the Privacy class (itself derived from
object) ensures that certain attributes are never changed: its __setattr__
method raises PrivacyError (see above) if the attribute is in the set of the
'privates' attribute: if o is constructed from a class that is derived from
Privacy, then if we write o.attr = ..., and attr is one of the strings in
o.privates, then Python will raise PrivacyError in the inherited __setattr__
method.

The reasoning behind how Privacy works (see the Test class that is derived from
it) depends on our knowledge of how attributes are located: inside the object
or inside the class the object was constructed from. Here is the actual code and
an analysis of what is happening.

class PrivacyError(Exception):
    pass # inherit __init__/constructor
        

class Privacy:
    def __setattr__(self,attr_name,new_value):
        print('__setattr__:',attr_name,'to be set to',new_value,'; privates = ',self.privates) # for illustration
        if attr_name in self.privates:
            raise PrivacyError('Privacy: attempt to set private: '+
                               attr_name+' to '+str(new_value))
        else:
            self.__dict__[attr_name] = new_value

class Test(Privacy): #mix-in a single base class: Privacy
    privates = {'y'} # y attribute of Test objects cannot be changed after __init__

    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.privates = set() # allow setting x y attributes; privates found here
        self.x = x  
        self.y = y
        del self.privates # use class name privates above for future privacy

        
t = Test(0,1)
t.x = 'changed'
t.y = 'changed'

Note the print statement in Privacy.__setattr__. When we run this program it
prints

__setattr__: privates to be set to set() ; privates =  {'y'}
__setattr__: x to be set to 0 ; privates =  set()
__setattr__: y to be set to 1 ; privates =  set()
__setattr__: x to be set to changed ; privates =  {'y'}
__setattr__: y to be set to changed ; privates =  {'y'}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\pattis\Desktop\python32\ztest\experiment.py", line 35, in <module>
    t.y = 'changed'
  File "C:\Users\pattis\Desktop\python32\ztest\experiment.py", line 10, in __setattr__
    attr_name+' to '+str(new_value))
__main__.PrivacyError: Privacy: attempt to set private: y to changed

Here is an explanation of all the actions (some are a bit subtle)

(1) When Python defines the Test class it has two attributes: privates is a
name in the class namespace bound to {'y'} and __init__ is bound to its defined
method.

(2) When Python executes t = Test(0,1), Test.__init__ is called.

  (2a) When Python executes self.privates = {}, it calls the __setattr__ method
  inherited from Privacy; at this point it looks up self.privates, doesn't find
  'privates' in the object (yet; see the result of this statement) so it tries
  to look up the attribute in the Test class, where its value is {'y'}; since
  'privates' -which is being bound- is not in this set, __setattr__ binds the
  'privates' attribute to {} IN THE OBJECT being constructed.

  (2b) When Python executes self.x = x, it calls the __setattr__ method
  inherited from Privacy; at this point it looks up self.privates, and finds
  'privates' IN THE OBJECT (see 2a), where its value is {}; since 'x' is not in
  this set, __setattr__ binds the 'x' attribute to 0 in the object being
  constructed.

  (2c) When Python executes self.y = y, the same series of events happen (as
  in 2b), and  __setattr__ binds the 'y' attribute to 1 in the object being
  constructed.

  (2d) When Python executes del self.privates it removes the 'privates'
  attribute from the self object. After __init__ finishes, the object created
  will not have a 'privates' attribute, so in the future when Python looks up
  self.privates in __setattr__, it will find the 'privates' attribute not in
  the object but instead in the Test class (bound to {'y'}) from which the
  object was constructed.

(3) When Python executes t.x = 'changed',  it calls the __setattr__ method
  inherited from Privacy; at this point it looks up self.privates, and finds
  'privates' in the Test class (bound to {'y'}); since 'x' is not in this set,
  __setattr__ binds the 'x' attribute in t's object to 'changed'.

(3) When Python executes t.y = 'changed',  it calls the __setattr__ method
  inherited from Privacy; at this point it looks up self.privates, and finds
  'privates' in the Test class (bound to {'y'}); since 'y' is in this set,
  __setattr__ raises an exception.

Here is a second, simpler definition and use (in Test) of Privacy, but with a
bit of a difference in meaning. In the code below, any new attribute is allowed
to be added to the namespace of an object (e.g., in the Test.__init__ or
elsewhere) but once an attribute is in the namespace of an object, it cannot be
rebound if it appears in the 'privates' attribute. Here are the changed classes.

class Privacy:
    def __setattr__(self,attr_name,new_value):
        print('__setattr__:',attr_name,self.privates) # for illustration
        if attr_name in self.__dict__ and attr_name in self.privates:
            raise PrivacyError('Privacy: attempt to set private: '+
                               attr_name+' to '+str(new_value))
        else:
            # either defining a first time or not private
            self.__dict__[attr_name] = new_value


class Test(Privacy):
    privates = {'y',} # y attribute of Test1 objects cannot be changed

    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x  
        self.y = y

The same lines of code

t = Test(0,1)
t.x = 'changed'
t.y = 'changed'

now produce very simlar results (the only difference is that printing
self.privates is always {'y'}). But when __init__ sets attribute 'y' Privacy
allows it, because 'y' is not currently bound to any value.

__setattr__: x {'y'}
__setattr__: y {'y'}
__setattr__: x {'y'}
__setattr__: y {'y'}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\inheritance\privacy.py", line 25, in <module>
    t.y = 'changed'

    attr_name+' to '+str(new_value))

----------

As a second mix-in example we will define a class that implements an interesting
__str__ method. Then, we will write the Test class shown above to mix-in both
this class and Privacy. But first, let's use our knowledge of inheritance to
better understand what happens when __str__ is called on an object constructed
from the Test class, which does not define a __str__ method. Assume as above,
t = Test(0,1).

Notice the Test class defined above defines no __repr__ or __str__ functions.
When we call print(t), Python converts t to a str (the only things it can print)
by calling t.__str__(). Now, the t object itself defines no __str__ attribute,
so Python tries to look up this attribute in the Test class, but it also doesn't
define a __repr__ or __str__ method. So Python next looks in the base class of
Test, which is Privacy; but it also doesn't define a __repr__ or __str__ method.
So Python next looks in the base class of Privacy, which is object. Now the
object class does define only a __repr__ method (which __str__ calls too). It
returns a string like '<__main__.Test object at 0x027482F0>' showing just the
name of the class of t and its location in memory (all objects come froma class
and have a location in memory). So, that is how a class that doesn't define
__repr__ or __str__ methods ultimately produces a string representing the 
class: it calls the one inherited from the object class.

The mix-in class Str_All_Attributes defines only a __str__ method, as follows.
It returns a string saying what class the object is an instance of, and then
lists (on separate lines) each attribute of the object, in alphabetical order,
and its value.

class Str_All_Attributes:
    def __str__(self):
        from goody import type_as_str
        answer = 'Instance of ' +type_as_str(self)+'\n'
        for a in sorted(self.__dict__):
            answer += '  ' + a + ' -> ' + str(self.__dict__[a]) + '\n'
        return answer

Now we can define Test as follows, using both mix-in classes

class Test(Privacy,Str_All_Attributes):

When we define t = Test(0,1) and call print(t) Python looks up the __str__
attribute using the bread-first search discussed in the previous lecture.

Python tries to look up the attribute in the t object itself, but it doesn't
define a __repr__ or __str__ method. Python next tries to look up this
attribute in the Test class, but it also doesn't define a __repr__ or __str__
method. So Python next looks in the first base class of Test, which is Privacy;
but it also doesn't define a __repr__ or __str__ method. So Python next looks
in the second base class, which is Str_All_Attributes. Now this class does
define a __str__ method. It prints the string as

Instance of __main__.Test
  x -> 0
  y -> 1

By defining

class Test(Privacy,Str_All_Attributes):

Any Test objects will check rebinding attempts via the __setattr__ method
inherited from Privacy and will print via the __str__ method inherited from
Str_All_Attributes.

So, it is very simple to derive a class from a variety of mix-in base classes,
and have the derived class inherit all the behaviors of the mixin classes. But
note that if two mix-in base classes define the same method, if that method is
called, it will be called only from the class that is the first one found in
the standard breadth-first search in the inheritance hierarchy. Therefore, one
must be carefully when using mix-in inheritance.

1) Define a class name Controlled_Keys_Dict that allows us to specify that some
keys are unchangable: they can be set to associate with a value, but only if
they are not already in the dictionary (if they are already in the dictionary
they cannot be changed). For d in this class, we can call d.control(...) to
specify which keys are controlled (its argument can be any iterable). Thus if
we call d.control(d.keys()) it would controll all the keys currently in that
dictionary.

2) Suppose we define

t1 = Test(0,1)
t2 = Test(0,1)
t1.privacy = {'x'}

Can we change t1.x? t1.y? t2.x? t2.y? Explain your reasoning.

3) Write a version of Str_All_Attributes that includes not only the
attributes of the object, but all its inherited attributes. See the
inheritancetool2 module for some useful code.
