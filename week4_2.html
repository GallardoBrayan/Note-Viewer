<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this lecture we will first learn how to fix a problem (related to sharing
objects) with the prange class that we wrote in the last lecture, by using a
nested class for iteration. Next, we look at a type that stores and manipulates
data, and also allows iteration over its data. Finally, we will begin to explore
functions and classes that operate on iterables and produce other iterables
(e.g., sorted and reversed are two examples built into Python, but there are
many other interesting and useful ones). We will finish the week with a lecture
about a special kind of function called a generator, which provides an
simple and excellent mechanism for writing iterators (and iterators that
decorate iterators). All this material will become even more important and
useful when we spend a week talking about inheritance among classes.
</pre>

<a name="fix"><h1>Fixing a sharing problem with prange</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In the last lecture we discussed various classes that implemented the iterator
protocol (by implementing the methods __iter__ and __next__). Typically in these
cases (for both the Countdown and prange classes) the main purpose of the class
was to create an object to iterate over once. That is, we processed objects from
these classes only (or primarily) by iterating over them. Contrast these classes
to the list, tuple, set, and dict class: while we often iterate over these
objects, we also peform many other useful operations on them too: e.g.,
examining and/or updating data in them.

Often we construct an object from Countdown and prange only for use in a for
loop: e.g., for i in prange(...) : .... We don't even bind this object to a
name, so the objects are used just in the for loop and cannot be reused.

But at the end of the last lecture we started discussing sharing, and we will
start our discussion here by looking at another example of sharing, and how to
fix a defect in our first implementation of the prange class (so that it behaves
more like range). It will involve defining and constructing a class nested in
the prange class, whose sole purpose is to construct an object returned by
__iter__ and provide a __next__ method for this object to allow us to iterate
over it. We will see that when we write iterators for other classes, controlling
more complicated data, this same technique works nicely.

To illustate the defect, we first define the following function, which uses a
doubly-iterating comprehension to return all pairs of values produced by its
argument iterators. Here i1 and i2 are two objects that are iterable.

def all_pair(i1,i2):
    return [(x,y) for x in i1 for y in i2]

this code is equivalent to

def all_pair(i1,i2):
    answer = []
    for x in i1:
        for y in i2:
            answer.append((x,y))
    return answer
    
Now let's run this function in various interesting ways, with range/prange (in
one case, illustrating a difference in how these classes perform).

r = range (3)
p = prange(3)

print(all_pair(r,p))	# use range and prange
print(all_pair(p,r))	# use prange and range
print(all_pair(r,r))	# use only range, but twice
print(all_pair(p,p))	# use only prange, but twice

These four print statements produce the following results. Notice the first
three result are the same (producing tuples containing all pairs of the values
in the range), but differ from the fourth (producing only the first of the
tuples). The difference occurs when the same prange iterable argument is passed
to both parameters.

[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]

The problem is that when __iter__ is called on a prange, it returns the object
itself on which __iter__ was called. The last use of p (using it twice in a
call to all_pair) above produces the wrong results. Both for loops in the
all_pair function share the iterator/object: the outer loop initializes it and
gets the first value, then the inner loop re-initializes it and gets the values
0, 1, 2; when the inner for loop exhausts the iterator, it is also exhausted in
the outer for loop (so the outer loop immediately terminates after producing
only 3 tuples). Python's standard range function doesn't suffer from problem,
and we will fix prange to operate likewise.

As a reminder, here is how prange defined __iter__ and __next__ in the previous
lecture.

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = self.start
        return self # must return an object on which __next__ can be called
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or \
           self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
            raise StopIteration
        save = self.n
        self.n += self.step
        return save

__iter__ sets a new instance name n (at least new since __init__ which did not
set it) and returns self; __next__ (written in prange) uses this instance name
and the stop/step instance names to advance the iterator. The problem is that
when all_pair tries to doubly iterate over the same prange object it will be
using the same object in the first/outer iteration as the second/inner
iteration. When the second/inner iteration starts it calls __iter__ on the same
object, clobbering the state being maintained by the first/outer iteration
(because both are using the same prange object). When the second iteration
finishes, Python thinks the first is finished too (the one object being used has
its self.n set beyond its last value, which is why the second/innner iteration
stopped. So, after generating (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) and finishing the second
iteration, Python thinks that the first iteration has finished too.

We will now fix this problem.

Here is how we do it. We define the local class prange_iter inside the __iter__ 
method. Every time we call __iter__ it creates a new object with its OWN STATE,
so multiple iterations on the same prange object don't interact badly with each
other because nested loops call __iter__ multiple times, and each call creates
it own prange_iter object with its own state. The prange_iter class has just two
methods: __init__  to initialize it with the information needed to iterate over
the prange object, and __next__ to advance the iteration of the prange object.

The __init__ method defines the instance names n, stop, and step (note that
start is not needed: it is used to initialize self.n); the __next__ method has
exactly the same code as the method above (but now applying to the prange_iter
object; of course, this code never referred to self.start). The final line of
code in __iter__ just constructs and returns the necessary prange_iter object
using prrange values: prange_iter(self.start,self.stop,self.step). This object
is constructed from a class that implements __next__ (as required). The __next__
defined is the same as before, but now in defined in prange_iter instead of
prange itself.

    def __iter__(self):
        class prange_iter:
            def __init__(self,start,stop,step):
                self.n    = start
                self.stop = stop
                self.step = step
            def __next__(self):
                if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or \
                   self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
                    raise StopIteration
                save = self.n
                self.n += self.step
                return save

        return prange_iter(self.start,self.stop,self.step)

All of the examples in this lecture will contain code like this, with the
__iter__ method defining a LOCAL or NESTED CLASS (this local class defines only
the __init__ and__next__ methods) and returning an object constructed from this
local/nested class.

The total amount of code isn't much bigger, but it is certainly more complicated
to define and use the nested class inside the __iter__ method (and think about
it). Now every call to __iter__ returns a different object that has a __next__,
so two uses of the same prange object (as in all_pair(p,p) above) will now work
correctly. Finally, we could also write the following code, which declares
prange_iter not inside __init__ but in the prange class itself. The code for
class prange_iter is identical (except outdented) but the call to __iter__ is
now just one line calling the constructor for this class.

    class prange_iter:
        def __init__(self,start,stop,step):
            self.n    = start
            self.stop = stop
            self.step = step

        def __next__(self):
            if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or \
               self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
                raise StopIteration
            save = self.n
            self.n += self.step
            return save
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return prange.prange_iter(self.start,self.stop,self.step)

Generally, names should be defined in the most restricted place they can be,
to avoid accidental misuse. This rule means that the original definition of
prange_iter (inside the __iter__ method) is probably the best location to
define it.

But, let's look at one other issue that favors the definition directly above.
Imagine that we wanted to be able to write the following

r = prange(10)
for i in r.iter_skip(2):           # skip 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... values: 
    print(i,end='')

We can also write this without the name r as just

for i in prange(10).iter_skip(2):  # skip 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... values: 
    print(i,end='')

In both cases, the code prints 13579, not 123456789.

That is, we wanted to be able to iterate through this range normally and also
by skipping values it would normally produce. We can solve this problem more
easily using the code directly above, with both the __iter__ and .iter_skip
methods constructing and returning prange_iter objects as follows (which we
couldn't do if prange_iter were defined inside __iter__)

    class prange_iter:
        def __init__(self,start,stop,step):
            self.n    = start
            self.stop = stop
            self.step = step

        def __iter__(self):
            return prange.prange_iter(self.n,self.stop,self.step)

        def __next__(self):
            if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or \
               self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
                raise StopIteration
            save = self.n
            self.n += self.step
            return save
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return prange.prange_iter(self.start,self.stop,self.step)

    def iter_skip(self,multiple):
        return prange.prange_iter(self.start,self.stop,self.step*multiple)

The iter_skip method just multiplies the prange's step by multiple, when it
constructs an iterable. The final observation here concerns why an __iter__
method is defined inside the prange_iter class. We have seen that when we write

  for i in r.iter_skip(2):  # skip 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... values: 

Python translates it into a while loop, with the initializing definition

  _hidden = iter(r.iter_skip(2))

So iter(...) is called on the prange_iter object returned by calling
r.iter_skip(2). So, this object must have an __iter__ method, which just
returns a copy of itself: the same object that r.iter_skip(2) already
constructed and returned. Without the __iter__ method in the prange_iter class,
Python would throw an exception when calling iter(...) on the prange_iter
object that a call to .iter_skip returns.

<a name="store"><h1>Classes that store interesting data and have iterators over the data</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Examine the definition of the following class that stores and processes
histograms. For simplicity we will assume it processes percentages (ints from
0 to 100) and places them in 10 bins: 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, ... 80-89, 90-100;
note that the last bin really reprsents 11 values, while all the others
represent 10 values. Of course we will focus on the how to accomplish iteration
for objects of this class (iterating over the counts in their bins) but there
are other interesting aspects about this class that we will discuss first (and
we could always generalize or add methods to make this class even more
powerful).

class Percent_Histogram:
    def __init__(self,init_percents=[]):
        self.histogram = 10*[0]    # [0,0,0,...,0,0] length 10
        for p in init_percents:
            self.tally(p)
         
    # Called when 0<= p <=100: 100//10 is 10 but belongs in index 9
    def _tally(self,p):
        self.histogram[p//10 if p< 100 else 9] += 1
    
    def clear(self):
        for i in range(10):         # vs self.histogram = 10*[0]
            self.histogram[i] = 0

    # tally allows any number of arguments, collected in a tuple
    def tally(self,*args):
        if len(args) == 0
            raise IndexError('Percent_Histogram.tally: no value(s) to tally')
        for p in args:
            if 0 <= p <= 100:
                self._tally(p)
            else:
                raise IndexError('Percent_Histogram.tally: '+str(p)+' outside [0,100]')

    # allow indexing for bins [0-9]
    # but can mutate these values only through __init__, clear, and tally
    # no __setitem__ defined
    def __getitem__(self,bin_num):
        if 0 <= bin_num <= 9:
            return self.histogram[bin_num]
        else:
            raise IndexError('Percent_Histogram.__getitem__: '+str(bin_num)+' outside [0,9]')

    # standard __iter__: defines a class with __init__/__next__ and returns
    #   an object from that class
    def __iter__(self):
        class PH_iter:
            def __init__(self,histogram):
                self.histogram = histogram          # sharing
                # self.historgram = list(histogram) # copying
                self.next = 0
            def __next__(self):
                if self.next == 10:
                    raise StopIteration
                answer = self.histogram[self.next]
                self.next += 1
                return answer

        return PH_iter(self.histogram)
            
    # To reconstruct a call the __init__ that reproduces the correct counts in
    #   the histogram, we supply the correct number of values, but all at the
    #   start of the bin: e.g., if bin 5 has 3 items, the repr has three 50s
    def __repr__(self):
        param = []
        for i in range(10):
            param += self[i]*[i*10]
        return 'Percent_Histogram('+str(param)+')'
    
    # a 2-dimensional display; do you understand the use of .format here?
    def __str__(self):
        return '\n'.join(['[{l: >2}-{h: >3}] | {s}'.format(l=10*i,h=10*i+9 if i != 9 else 100,s=self[i]*'*') for i in range(10)])

Notes:

0) The __init__ method uses the idiom 10*[0] which you should know. If not,
experiment with it.

1) The _tally function is supposed to be called by only methods defined in this
class. It puts a number in the range [0,100] into the correct bin, treating 100
specially (it belongs in bin 9, but p//10 would put it in bin 10, which doesn't
exist).

2) The clear method sets each bin in the list to 0; we could have allocated a
new list as shown in the comment, but generally that takes more time and
occupies more space.

3) By using *args, the tally method can have any number (0 or more) of
positional arguments. All arguments are collected into tuple that is iterated 
over to process the value individually. If there is not at least one value, or
any value is out of range, this method raises an exception.

4) The __getitem__ method allows us to index all the bins, 0-9 inclusive of a
Histogrm object. Note that we can set values into these bins (i.e., mutate the
list), only via __init__ and tally. So we call this information read-only: we
can read it but not write/change it.

5) We use the now standard way to implement __iter__, by defining a class that
defines __next__ and returning an object from that class. We will discuss how
changing self.histogram = histogram vs. self.histogram = list(histogram) changes
the iterator.

6) The __repr__ method doesn't know what numbers went into the bins, but we can
use the lowest number in each bin, repeated by the count in the bin, to specify
a list needed to construct an equivalent object (with the equivalent number of
values in each bin) with the construtor.

7) The __str__ method returns a two-dimensional plot of the histogram. Do you
all know how to use the format method for strings? If not you should look it
up (it is described online using something like EBNF) and practice using it. You
should certainly be able to tell me why the string that .format is called on
produces the result you'll see.

When Python executes the following script:

quiz1 = Percent_Histogram([50, 55, 70, 75, 85, 100])
quiz1.tally(20,30,95)
print(repr(quiz1))
for count in quiz1:
    print(count,end=' ')
print(quiz1)

It prints the following information:

Percent_Histogram([20, 30, 50, 50, 70, 70, 80, 90, 90])
0 0 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 2 
[ 0-  9] | 
[10- 19] | 
[20- 29] | *
[30- 39] | *
[40- 49] | 
[50- 59] | **
[60- 69] | 
[70- 79] | **
[80- 89] | *
[90-100] | **

Normally we would use this class in a program that reads a file of scores.
Now, what would happen if we executed the following code?

for count in quiz1:
    print(count,end=' ')
    quiz1.tally(100)

It would print: 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 11 (and at this point quiz1[9] is 12)

Note that mutating the quiz1 object during each iteration would result in the
new, accumulated values for the results produce by the iterator (in the last
bin). That is because the PH_iter object refers to (shares) the same list that
the Histogram class created (and that the tally method increments). So that
sharing results in the iterator always returning the most up-to-date value in
the list.

What if we wanted to have the iterator produce the values in the histogram when
the iteration started, and not show any updates after that. The change is
trivial: in PH_iters's __iter__ method we change

                self.histogram =  histogram
to 
                self.histogram =  list(histogram)

Now instead of this iterator object sharing the list being using for the
histogram, it has its own copy: a new/different list, but storing all the
original list's values. So, changes to the original list will not change the
self.histogram list and therefore not change the result of the iteration. The
cost: extra space used for the list (not much, because the list always contains
just 10 values) and some extra time to construct the list.

So, we need to decide (and document) the semantics for our iterators. Can you
tell (and if so, with what code) what decision was made concerning this issues
for the list iterator, and discuss why you think the designers made that
decision?

In fact, because there are iterators for lists built-into Python, we could in
fact simplify __iter__ to delegate to the list class:

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.histogram)

for sharing behavior; and for copying behavior

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(list(self.histogram))

because the list class supports an __iter__ method, on whose restult __next__
can be called. So defining and advancing our own indexes in the PH_iter class
is not strictly necessary. But this code illustrates how the list iterator
works and such simplifications are not possible for other classes that store
more complicated data structures.

<a name="decorators"><h1>Iteraterable Decorators: Classes that are initialized by/implement iterable</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Since iterators are so important, it is useful to have a grab-bag of classes
(this lecture) and generators (next lecture) that operate on iterables to
produce more iterables. When a class takes as an argument an object that has
methods implementing a certain protocol and returns an object that implements
the same protocol, the class is called a decorator. We will write a bunch of
classes that decorate iterables below (and even more in the next lecture). These
are all pretty simple to think about, and while the code is complicated, it is
complicated in the same way each time.

In all these examples, you will not see an explicit "raise StopIteration";
instead, this exception is raised when calling some next on the iterable it is
iterating over.

Here is a first example of a decorator for iterable and a refinement of it.
The Repeat class takes an iterable as an argument and implements an __iter__
method that repeats that iterator over and over: whenever it runs out of
values to produce, the entire sequence of values is produced again.

We can test this class with any iterable, and strings are the simplest, so we
will demonstrate this class using a string. If we run the script

for i in Repeat("abcde"):
    print(i,end=''))

Python would print: abcdeabcdeabcde ... and keep going forever

Here is that class

class Repeat:
    def __init__(self,iterable):
        self.iterable = iterable
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Repeat_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable):
                self.iterable = iterable       # remember for reuse in next
                self.iterator = iter(iterable) # remember for direct use in next
            
            def __next__(self):
                try:
                    return next(self.iterator)
                except StopIteration:
                    self.iterator = iter(self.iterable) # reuse iterable
                    return next(self)               # calls __next__ recursively

        return Repeat_iter(self.iterable)

This uses the same define-a-class-in-the-__iter__-method used in the prange and
Histogram classes above.

We can generalize this class to Repeat an iterator either at most some fixed
number of times or forever, using the following class. If the second argument
to __init__ is an integer, it repeats the iterable at most that many times; if
there is no second argumment, the iterator repeats forever (as above).

class Repeat:
    def __init__(self,iterable,max_times=None):
        self.iterable  = iterable
        self.max_times = max_times
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Repeat_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable,max_times):
                self.iterable       = iterable
                self.max_times_left = max_times
                self.iterator       = iter(iterable)
            
            def __next__(self):
                if self.max_times_left != None and self.max_times_left <= 0:
                    raise StopIteration
                else:
                    try:
                        return next(self.iterator)
                    except StopIteration:
                        if self.max_times_left != None:
                            self.max_times_left -= 1 
                        self.iterator = iter(self.iterable)
                        return next(self) # calls __next__ recursively

        return Repeat_iter(self.iterable,self.max_times)

If we run the script

for i in Repeat("abcde",3):
    print(i,end=''))

Python would print: abcdeabcdeabcde

Here is a third decorator for iterables. It returns all the values in an
iterable, but never the same value twice. We call this class Unique. It works
by keeping a set in each Unique_iter object that remembers and bypasses
returning any value already returned from that iterator object.

class Unique:
    def __init__(self,iterable):
        self.iterable = iterable
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Unique_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable):
                self.iterated = set()
                self.iterator = iter(iterable)
            
            def __next__(self):
                answer = next(self.iterator)
                while answer in self.iterated:
                    answer = next(self.iterator)
                self.iterated.add(answer)
                return answer

        return Unique_iter(self.iterable)

If we run the script

for i in Unique('Mississippi'):
    print(i,end='')

Python prints: Misp

We can also generalize this class by specifying the maximum number of times a
value can be returned (with a default argument of 1, which brings us back to
version of Unique specified above, since it allows values to be returned only
once). This is a trivial but interesting example of generalizing classes with
backward compatibility of use. Here we replace a set of "iterated-over" values
by a dictionary with these values as keys associated with the number of times
this value has been returned.

from collections import defaultdict  
class Unique:
    def __init__(self,iterable,max_times=1):
        self.iterable  = iterable
        self.max_times = max_times
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Unique_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable,max_times):
                self.times     = defaultdict(int)
                self.iterator  = iter(iterable)
                self.max_times = max_times
            
            def __next__(self):
                answer = next(self.iterator)
                while self.times[answer] >= self.max_times:
                    answer = next(self.iterator)
                self.times[answer] += 1
                return answer

        return Unique_iter(self.iterable,self.max_times)

If we run the script:

for i in Unique('Mississippi',2):
    print(i,end='')

Python prints: Missipp

As another example, we will write the Filter class, which is supplied with
a predicate function (of one argument that returns a bool), indicating whether a
value should be produced by the iterable or filtered out, causing next to be
called again, until it finds a value to return that is ok by the predicate.

class Filter:
    def __init__(self,iterable,predicate):
        self.iterable  = iterable
        self.predicate = predicate
        
    def __iter__(self):
        class Filter_iter:
            def __init__(self,iterable,predicate):
                self.iterator  = iter(iterable)
                self.predicate = predicate
            
            def __next__(self):
	        answer = next(self.iterator)
		while self.predicate(answer) == False:
		    answer = next(self.iterator)
		return answer

        return Filter_iter(self.iterable,self.predicate)

If we run the script:

for i in Filter('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',lambda x : x not in 'richardpattis'):
    print(i,end='')           

Python prints all the letters not in my name: befgjklmnoquvwxyz 

Notice that the Repeat, Unique, and Filter classes all implement their iterators
similarly, with the same pattern of code. In the next lecture we will rewrite
these decorators -and even more decorators- much more simply as generators, 
which allow us to capture the pattern above much more easily.

Here is a last decorator for iterables. Its calls to next return all the values
in an iterable but in sorted order. In this implementation we collect all the
values from the iterator into a list and then sort the list and return its
iterator (since the values are all in the correct order). We cannot know what
smallest value to return until we have seen all the values.

class psorted: # pseudo-sorted: works just like sorted
    def __init__(self,iterable,key=None,reverse=False):
        self.result = list(iterable) # put all values in a list
        self.result.sort(key=key,reverse=reverse)
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.result)

Actually, "sorted" in Python is simpler: it is a function that returns a list
(so it still returns something that is iterable). So, psorted might be more
clearly written as

def psorted(iterable,key=None,reverse=False):
    result = list(iterable)                   # put all values in a list
    result.sort(key=key,reverse=reverse)      # calling sort returns None
    return result			      # so return in another statement

Finally, notice how we can combine these decorator classes below. Suppose I
want to print out all the letters in my name in alphabetical order, with no
repetition of letters. I can do it with the following script. Note that the
string argument to psorted is iteratble, and psorted itself returns an iterable
(so the argument to Unique is iterable) and finally Unique is iterable as well
(which is needed by the for loop)

for i in Unique(psorted('richardpattis')):
    print(i,end='')

It prints: acdhiprst

What would the following script print? It reverse the order of the classes
being constructed.

for i in psorted(Unique('richardpattis')):
    print(i,end='')

<a name="problems"><h1>Problems</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Explain what happens (and why) if we write the following loops

   for c in Repeat(''): ...?
   for c in Repeat('',4): ...?

each with an empty iterator (produces no values). Explain alternative (more
reasonable?) behavior and how we can implement it.

2) Explain what happens in each of the following situations, which uses a list
as the iterable being decorated: will the appended value be printed.

  l = [...] # some list
  i = 0
  for u in Unique(l):
      print(u)
      i += 1
      if i == 1:
          l.append(...) # append a value to l that is not already there

  l  = [...] # some list
  ui = Unique(l)
  l.append(...) # append a value to l that is not already there
  for u in ui:
      print(u)

Explain how we could modify the Unique class to get the opposite behavior.

3) Here is another way to write the __next__ method in the Filter_iter class.
Compare this loop with the one in the code above as to simplicity/clarity.

                while True:
                    answer = next(self.iterator)
                    if self.predicate(answer):
                        return answer

4) Expain why the iterable passed as an argument to the psorted class must
be finite.

5) Define a preversed class similar to the sorted class above, which acts as a
decorator for iterables. You may not use reversed in your code. Hint: it uses
a combination of creating a list from the iterable and the iterator in the
Histogram class (although using a range iterator might simplify the code).

6) Define a Random class, which acts as a decorator for iterables: it returns
each value with a probability (a float between 0-never- and 1-always) specified
when the object is constructed. Account for the fact that the iterator might
produce an infinite number of values. Write this in a straightforward way, then
write it in a simpler way using the Filter class.

7) Define a Skipping class, which acts as a decorator for iterables: it skips
the first n values (n is specified as an argument to __init__) and then 
produces the same value as its iterable argument. So the following loop skips
the first three values when iteratin over the string 'abcdefg'

  for c in Skipping('abcdefg',3):
      print(c,end='')

and prints: defg
