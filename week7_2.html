<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
This short lecture extends our discussion of inheritance from single-inheritance
to multiple-inheritance: we will learn how to visualize multiple-inheritance
relationships (not as a N-ary tree, but as a more complicated network) and how
to generalize the rules Python uses for locating attributes. We can use the
inheritancetool.py module, along with any classes forming an inheritance
hierarchy, to see how Python locates such attributes. We can use this tool with
the module defining the Counter/Modular_Counter classes, and with the
inheritancesample.py module, which defines a more complicated hierarchy
discussed below.

Visualizing Multiple-Inheritance Hierarchies

Examine the class structure below, which we have simplified by showing just
the class statement with a body of pass.

class B1a     : pass	   # object is the base class of the derived class B1
class B1(B1a) : pass	   # B1a is the base class of the derived class B1
class B2      : pass	   # object is the base class of derived class B2
class C(B1,B2): pass	   # B1 and B2 (in that order) are the base classes of C

We can visualize the relationship betweeen the derived and base classes using
the same building blocks we used for single-inheritance: a derived class refers
upward to its direct base class. The three pictures below are all logically
equivalent: although the "location" of some of the classes  are different in the
pictures, in all cases B1 is the first/left base class from which C is derived;
B2 is the second/right base class from which C is derived; B1 is derived solely
from B1a, and B1a and B2 themselves are each derived from the base class
object.

        object			object			  
         ^   ^                   ^   ^	         	  
        /     \		        /     \			
      B1a     B2 	      B1a     |		     B1a --> object
       ^       ^               ^      |		      ^       ^
       |       |	       |      |		      |       |
       B1      /              B1     B2		      B1      B2
        ^     /                ^      ^		       ^      ^
         \   /		        \    /		        \    /
           C                       C		           C

Because of the extra complexity of multiple-inheritance, the relationships can
form a complex network that cannot be captured by a simple N-ary tree: for
example above C has two paths to the root, object, which is disallowed in trees.

For a reason described in the next section, we will prefer the LEFTMOST
visualization: it allows us to more easily apply the rules for locating
attributes.

To draw these inheritance networks, we start at the most derived class, and
then draw all its base classes (in the order they appear in the class
definition, mirroring the left to right ordering), directly above the class(es)
derived from them, with arrows leading from the derived class to the base class.
For the example above, because C is dertived from B1 and B2 (in that order),
they appear (in that left to right order) above C; because B1 is derived from
B1a, and B1a is derived from object, B1a appears above B1 and object appears
above B1a; because B2 is derived from object, object appears above B2 also.

These networks can get messy to visualize, with more complicated relationships
among the classes, but the picture layout is not what is important: what is
important is the individual logical relationships (which derived classes refer
to which base classes), which are directly used to locate attributes.

<a name="locate"><h1>Locating Attributes in Multiple-Inheritance Hierarchies</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The rules Python uses for locating an attribute in an inheritance hierarchy is
now easy to state (if you understand the concept of pre-order search (a kind of
depth-first search), discussed in the second trees lecture, although applied
here to networks.

  Python first tries to find the attribute in the instance object; if Python
  fails, it performs a pre-order search (left before right) upward from the
  class the object was constructed from (which appears at the bottom of the
  network), towards the root/object class. If it reaches any base class that
  has not already searched all of its derived classes, that base class is not
  searched now; instead the derived class searches its remaining (to the right)
  base classes; and if it has searched all its base classes, it derived class
  searches its remaining (to the right) base classes, etc.

In the inheritance network above, if c is an object constructed from class C,
and the attribute isn't found in c, Python searches the following classes in
following order, getting the attribute from the first class that defines it:
C, B1, B1a, B2, object. Here is why: It starts at C, then searches C's lefmost
base class B1, then searches B1's leftmost base class B1a. But when it sees
B1a's leftmost base class, object,  has another derived class (B2) that has not
been searched, Python doesn't search object yet. Instead it tries to search
B1a's other base classes; there are none, so it tries to seach B1's other base
classes; there are none, so it tries to search C's other base classes, and
there is one, B2. Then it seaches  B2's base classes, object, which is now
actually searched, because both of its base classes have been searched.
Finally, object has no base class to search..

How does the search know how to go from a derived class to its base class(es)?
Every class object has a __bases__ attribute that is a list of its base
classes; the order that it uses for the base classes in the list is the same
order the base classes appear in the class definition. So, the arrows shown in
the pictures above are really stored in Python class objects in the list named
__bases__. The arrows go only from derived classes to base classes, not base
classes to derived classes. So while every derived class knows the base classes
it is derived from, a base class does not know what derived classes are derived
from it.

Finally, when applied to a single-inheritance hierarchy, this algorithm
degenerates (each  __bases__ list has only one value in it) into looking from a
derived class to its single base class, to the single base class of that base
class, etc. until reaching the object class. We are already familiar with that
process.

In fact, Python has a function getattr (note, no underscores) that performs
exactly this task. It takes up to 3 arguments: an object (required), an
attribute for that object (as a string; required), and the value to return if
it cannot find that attribute for an object (optional). If the third argument
is not supplied, Python will raise AttributeError if it cannot find that
attribute for the object.

The order of classes that Python uses to search for an attribute name is 
computed when a class is defined and stored in the class name __mro__; it is
also retrievable by the method mro. So if C refers to a Class, then C.__mro__
or C.mro() is a list of classes (starting with C), in the order they are
searched.

The term "mro" stand for "method resolution order", but it applies to all
attributes, not just methods (so a better name would be aro). The code directly
below shows how the mro is used when searching for an attribute. It is followed
by code that computes the mro for each newly defined derived classes (based on
the mros computed for its base classes

The pgetattr function (pseudo getattr) defined below shows how Python locates
the value associated with any attribute of an_object. It locates the attribute
in an_object itself, or searches its inheritance hierarchy starting with the
class from which an_object is constructed. The inheritancetool.py module
includes this code (and the algorithm below used in computing the __mro__ list)

Note here how using *default will bind default to (,) which is the empty tuple
if no third argument is supplied

def pgetattr(an_object, attr,*default):
    # Try to locate attr in in object itself
    # Otherwise try to locate it in the classes in the __mro__ list
    #   based on the type of an_object (in order), which starts with
    #   type(an_object).
    # Finally return default[0] (if a third argument, and no more, was specified) or
    #   raise AttributeError if it was not

    if attr in an_object.__dict__:
        return an_object.__dict__[attr]
    else:
        for c in type(an_object).__mro__:
            if attr in c.__dict__:
                return c.__dict__[attr]
    
    if len(default) == 1:
        return default[0]

    raise AttributeError("'"+type_as_str(an_object)+"' object has no attribute '"+attr+"'")

The actual getattr function a bit more complicated than pgetattr because it
works with some Python features that we have not discussed. But the general
outline is the same.

Now, let us see the algorithm to computer the __mro__ attribute of a derived
class, based on the __mro__ attributes of the base classes it is derived from.
The order requires 

  (1) Base classes must be searched in the order they appear in each derived
        class definition.
  (2) A derived class must be searched before any of the base class it was
         derived from.

This algorithm is known as the "C3 linearization algorith"
If there is no order that satsifies all these requirements (see below for an
example) then Python will raise a TypeError exception when the class is defined.

The following function compute the mro: it contains print statements (controlled
by the debugging parameter) to help illustrate its computation.

# bases is all the bases the new class is derived from
def compute_mro(*bases, debugging=False):
    # constraints is a list of lists; each inner list specifies the constraints
    #   for a base class or the new class (last, specified by *bases)
    # mro is the final order for searching all the base classes
    constraints = [list(c.__mro__) for c in bases] + [list(bases)]
    mro         = []
    
    # While there are constraints to satisfy
    while constraints:
        if debugging: print('\nConstraints =',constraints)
        
        # Find the first candidate in an inner constraint-list that does not appear anywhere
        #   but as the first in all other inner constraint-lists
        for const in constraints:
            candidate = const[0]
            if debugging: print('Trying candidate:',candidate)
            if not any([candidate in later[1:] for later in constraints]):
                if debugging: print('Selected candidate:',candidate)
                break
        else: # for finished without breaking; no candidate is possible!
            raise TypeError('Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases ' +\
                               ', '.join(str(b)[8:-2] for b in bases))

        # That candidate is next in the mro
        mro.append(candidate)
        
        # Remove candidate from being the first in any inner constraint-list
        for const in constraints:
            if const[0] == candidate:
                if debugging: print('Removing candidate from:', const)
                del const[0]
                
        # If any innner constraint-list has been reduced to [], remove it
        constraints = [c for c in constraints if c != []]
        
    return tuple(mro)

Given classes following classes, used at the start of this lecture note
  class B1a     : pass	# __mro__ is (B1a,object)
  class B1(B1a) : pass  # __mro__ is (B1,B1a,object)
  class B2      : pass  # __mro__ is (B2,object)

We can compute the mro for 
  class C(B1,B2): pass

by calling print('\nmro =',compute_mro(B1,B2,debugging=True)) which produces the
following results; match it with the English description of how the order (also
appearing at the start of the lecture note).

  Constraints = [[<class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B1a'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B2'>]]
  Trying candidate: <class '__main__.B1'>
  Selected candidate: <class '__main__.B1'>
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B1a'>, <class 'object'>]
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B2'>]

  Constraints = [[<class '__main__.B1a'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B2'>]]
  Trying candidate: <class '__main__.B1a'>
  Selected candidate: <class '__main__.B1a'>
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.B1a'>, <class 'object'>]

  Constraints = [[<class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.B2'>]]
  Trying candidate: <class 'object'>
  Trying candidate: <class '__main__.B2'>
  Selected candidate: <class '__main__.B2'>
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>]
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.B2'>]

  Constraints = [[<class 'object'>], [<class 'object'>]]
  Trying candidate: <class 'object'>
  Selected candidate: <class 'object'>
  Removing candidate from: [<class 'object'>]
  Removing candidate from: [<class 'object'>]

  mro = [<class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B1a'>, <class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>]

Note that we must prepend the C class itself to the result computed:
The actual mro for C is

  mro = (<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.B1'>, <class '__main__.B1a'>, <class '__main__.B2'>, <class 'object'>)

Now, look at the following example of class that CANNOT meet the requirements:

class A     : pass   # __mro__ is (A, object)
class B     : pass   # __mro__ is (B, object)
class C(A,B): pass   # __mro__ is (C, A, B, object)
class D(B,A): pass   # __mro__ is (D, B, A, object)
class E(C,D): pass   # __mro__ is not possible

Note here that for derived class E, the rules for its base class C require
searching A before B, but the rules for its base class D require searching B
before A. So given the definition of A, B, C, and D, calling 

We can compute the mro for 
  class E(C,D): pass   # __mro__ is not possible

by calling print('\nmro =',compute_mro(C,D,debugging=True))  which produces the
following results.

  Constraints = [[<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.D'>]]
  Trying candidate: <class '__main__.C'>
  Selected candidate: <class '__main__.C'>
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>]
  Removing candidate from: [<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.D'>]

  Constraints = [[<class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>], [<class '__main__.D'>]]

  TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases __main__.C, __main__.D

In such a case, the class raising the exception will not be defined: it cannot
be defined because it can have no legal search order for its attributes.

Here is a recursive version of the compute_mro function (sans debugging print
statements).

def compute_mro_r(*bases):
    def merge(constraints):
        if constraints == []:
            return ()
        else:
            for const in constraints:
                candidate = const[0]
                if not any([candidate in later[1:] for later in constraints]):
                    break
            else: # for finished without breaking; no candidate is possible!
                raise TypeError('Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases ' +\
                                   ', '.join(str(b)[8:-2] for b in bases))
            
            return (candidate,) + \
               merge([const[1:] if const[0] == candidate else const for const in constraints if const != [candidate]])
    return merge([list(c.__mro__) for c in bases] + [list(bases)])

Going back to the definitions

  class B1a     : pass	# __mro__ is (B1a,object)
  class B1(B1a) : pass  # __mro__ is (B1,B1a,object)
  class B2      : pass  # __mro__ is (B2,object)

We can compute the mro for 
  class C(B1,B2): pass

by computing compute_mro_r(B1,B2) which we can visualize as (dropping the
  '__main__.' from each class name)

= merge((B1a,object), (B1,B1a,object), (B2,object))
= (B1) + merge((B1a,object), (B1a,object), (B2,object))
= (B1) + (B1a) + merge((object,), (object,), (B2,object))
= (B1) + (B1a) + (B2) + merge((object,), (object,), (object,))
= (B1) + (B1a) + (B2) + (object)
= (B1, B1a, B2, object)

The actual mro for C is (C, B1, B1a, B2, object) 

Finally, __mro__ is as read-only attribute; after Python computes it, its value
cannot be changed (recall all the __setattr__ variants we wrote.

Finally, in the next lecture we will see many examples of single-inheritance
and multiple-inheritance. As of the end of this lecture, you should be able to
understand how Python treats all inheritance hierarchies in terms of locating
attributes.

<a name="meaning"><h1>The true meaning of the isinstance function (given inheritance)</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python's boolean function isinstance has two parameters: the first should be
bound to an instance object; the second to a class object. Before inheritance,
our understanding of the call isinstance(o,C) meant return True if instance
object o was constructed from class object C: we could restate this computation
using the is operator as equivalent to: type(o) is C.

But now that we know about inheritance we can clarify the the meaning of the
isinstance function: it is a bit more general. The isinstance(o,C) function
call still returns True if type(o) is C, but it also returns True if type(o)
is any class derived from C (meaning type(o) is derived from class C in one or
more steps). Stated another way, if isinstance(o,C) is True, it means that when
searching for attributes in o, eventually class C will be searched (if the
attribute is not found earlier), by the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented
Programming generalized in this lecture.

So, while 

  type(o) is C

truly asks whether o is an instance object constructed from class C,
isinstance(o,C) is asking whether C will be searched when trying to find
attributes in o. In the following picture isinstance(o,C) is True.

               C
               ^
               |
.....other Base Classes of type(o).....
               ^
               |
   type(o): actual class of o

Given what we learned above, we can easily describe the operation of
isinstance(o,C) in Python as

  C in type(o).__mro__

since type(o).__mro__ contains o's actually class and all the base classes its
class is derived from.

Note that isinstance(o,Object) is always True.

A very interesting fact is that if isinstance(o,C) is True and if a is an
attribute defined in class C, then writing o.a will always find a binding for
the attribute a (and never raise AttributeError): the binding will either come
from C itself (if the search goes all the way back to C) or from some class
