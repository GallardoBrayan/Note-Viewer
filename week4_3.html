<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python includes a special "kind of" function called a generator (also known
classically in Computer Science as a coroutine). With generators we can easily
(almost trivially) write iterators (although it takes a new way of thinking
about functions). In this lecture we will first study generators by themselves,
to understand their semantics, and then use them to write a variety of
iterators easily. I believe that the generator concept is one of the most
intuitively easy to understand features in Python (and powerful to boot), so I
think you will enjoy reading this lecture. Not many other languages include
coroutines in such an easy to use form.

Generators are defined almost exactly like functions; the one difference is that
inside a generator there are "yield" statements (one or more), not "return"
statements. A yield statement has the same form as a return statement: each
keyword is followed by an expression that is evaluated, terminating the
function/generator and returning that value: but a key difference is that
generators can be RESTARTED after executing a yield statement -and they restart
exactly where they left off in the computation. Python remembers this
information for generators, unlike functions.

When we call a FUNCTION, its parameters receive values from its arguments, its
body executes, and when it executes a return statement the specified value is
returned (or None is automatically returned if the last statement of a function
is executed without ever executing a return). When a function returns this
value, it is done and Python forgets the state of its parameter and local
variables, and it forgets where it executed the return: when called again, a
function starts at the beginning.

When we call a GENERATOR, likewise its parameters receive values from its
arguments, but Python does not start executing its body. The generator
"suspends". To execute its body we use the called generator as an argument to
the next(...) function. So calling a generator is similar to calling iter(...)
on an object: the result in both cases is something on which next(...) can be
called. In fact, we can use generators in for loops: calling iter(...) on a
generator (recall how iter(...) is called when Python executes for loops) just
returns the same generator.

Each time next is called the generator resumes from where it was suspended,
further executing its body. When it executes a yield statement the specified
value is returned. When a function yields a value it suspends (remembering the
state of its parameters, local variables, and its execution point). When we
call next(...) on it again, it resumes exactly where it left off. So, a
common/simple use for generators is in for loops: they know how to create a
generator, doing something like (but not the same thing as) calling iter(...)
on iterables and repeatedly calling next on it.

A generator can also raise the StopIteration exception: it is automatically
raised when the generator executes an explicit return statement, or if the last
statement of a generator is executed and Python executes an implicit return
statement from the generator.

-----

***Starting in Python 3.5, the only correct way for a generator to terminate
***when exhausted is by executing an explicit or implicit return. We should
***adopt this convention, whether using Python 3.5 or any earlier version -as we
***will in all the examples below.

***Starting in Python 3.5, if a generator explicitly raises the StopIteration
***exception (one that is not caught inside the generator), Python will actually
***raise the RuntimeError exception instead. So explicitly raising the
***StopIteration exception now signals a RuntimeError, not just normal
***termination of the generator. Executing a return will still raise the
***StopIteration exception signalling normal termination of a generator.

***In earlier Python versions, return and raise StopIteration were identical:
***both terminating the generator normally.

***Now, normal termination of the generator is signalled by executing an
***explicit or implicit return; raising StopIteration (which is translated into
***raising RuntimeError), signals an abnormal termination

-----

Now it is time for a concrete example that we will study, going back to apply
the rules stated above in particular cases. In the generator below, the while
loop is infinite (if max == None) or finite (p will get no bigger than max if
max != None). Each iteration checks whether the current p is a prime and yields
p's value if so; otherwise it increments p and checks if it is prime (unless p
has surpassed a non-None max). So primes is a generator that produces only
prime numbers: either finite number of them or primes without limits (there are
an infinite number of primes, so there is always another to produce).

from predicate import is_prime #  Could use any predicate
def primes(max = None):
    p = 2                           #2 is the first prime
    while max == None or p <= max:
        if is_prime(p):
            yield p
        p += 1 

Quick note: this while's test uses the short-circuit property of or: if
max == None is True, then the entire expression is True, so Python does not
have to evaluate the right operand; and if it did, it would raise an exception
because Python cannot compare p (an int value) to  None; instead it would raise
the exception: TypeError: unorderable types: int() <= NoneType().

Before looking at an example in detail that uses this generator, it is easy to
determine what it does: it yields only prime numbers, either without limit or
whose values are limited to be <= max. The code is straightford and does the
obvious thing: to most programmers its mechanism, suspending and resuming 
execution, is easy/intuitive to understand and use to write generators. If it
helps, think about yield like a print statement: this function yields/prints all
the required primes.

Let us determine what happens if we execute the following Python code, which
stores the result of calling the primes generator in pg (prime generator) and
then continues to print the values returned by calling next(pg). Note that
calling a generator like primes(10) is similar to calling iter(primes(10)):
both prepare the generator for use as a parameter to next(...).

pg = primes(10)
print(pg)
print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))

When Python executes this script, it produces the following results. An
explanation of these results follows.

  <generator object primes at 0x029C5850>
  2
  3
  5
  7
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\zexperiment\experiment.py", line 12, in <module>
      print(next(pg))
  StopIteration

When we call primes(10), this generator binds its parameter max to 10 and
suspends before executing its body. It doesn't run so doesn't yield any values
yet: but it will yield values when we call next on it, so it is similar to what
calling iter does. Generators print much like functions, indicating they are a
generator, named primes, and stored at a memory location (a value we are
unconcerned with knowing).

The first call of next(pg) resumes the suspended execution of the generator,
which binds p to 2 and then starts the while loop. Since max != None it will
continue to loop so long as p <= 10. It executes the body of the loop and the
if statement checks whether p (now 2) is prime; it is, so it yields the value 2
(returning (really we should say yielding) it from the generator and suspending
the generator for further use). Python prints 2.

The second call of next(pg) resumes the suspended execution of the generator
after the yield, which increments p to 3 and then re-executes the while loop's
body (p is <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 3) is prime; it is,
so it yields the value 3 (returning it from the generator and suspending the
generator). Python prints 3.

The third call of next(pg) resumes the suspended execution of the generator
after the yield, which increments p to 4 and then re-executes the while loop's
body (p is <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 4) is prime; it
isn't, so Python increments p to 5 and  re-executes the while loop's body
(p <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 5) is prime; it is, so, it
yields the value 5 (returning it from the generator and suspending the
generator). Python prints 5 (by skipping/not yielding the value 4).

The fourth call of next(pg) resumes the suspended execution of the generator
after the yield, which increments p to 6 and then re-executes the while loop's
body (p is <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 6) is prime; it
isn't, so Python increments p to 7 and re-executes the while loop's body
(p <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 7) is prime; it is, so, it
yields the value 7 (returning it from the generator and suspending the
generator). Python prints 7 (by skipping/not yielding the value 6).

The fifth call of next(pg) resumes the suspended execution of the generator,
after the yield, which increments p to 8 and then re-executes the while loop's
body (p is <= 10). The if statement checks whether p (now 8) is prime; it
isn't, so Python increments p to 9 and re-executes the while loop's body
(p <= 10). The if statment checks whether p (now 9) is prime; it isn't so
Python increments p to 10 and re-executes the while loop's body (p <= 10). The
if statment checks whether p (now 10) is prime; it isn't, so Python increments
p to 11 but terminates the loop (does not re-execute its body), because p > 10.

Because there are no more statements to execute in the generator, it implicitly
executes a return, which raises the StopIteration exception (which is not
handled in the code above, so it propagates to Python which terminates
execution of the script.

Note what happens if we reset pg to a new call of primes(10)

pg = primes(10)

print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))

pg = primes(10)

print(next(pg))
print(next(pg))

Python would print

  2
  3
  5
  2
  3

because calling primes(10) starts the generator over. If we wrote the script

p1 = primes(10)
p2 = primes(10)
print(next(p1))
print(next(p2))
print(next(p1))
print(next(p2))
print(next(p1))
print(next(p2))

Python would print

  2
  2
  3
  3
  5
  5

because we now have two different generators, and each works independently of
the other. So each time we call a generator, it constructs a new object to
iterate over.

Finally, although we have been slogging around with explicit calls to
next(...), which we can do with generators as we did with iterators, they are
most simple to use in the typical contexts in which we use iterators: for
loops. The script

for i in primes(50):
    print(i,end=' ')

would print all the primes <= 50: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47

And the script

for i in primes():
    print(i)

binds the parameter max to None (its default value) so the while loop would
be infinite, and it would keep printing primes forever: so the primes function
can either be a definite (bounded) or indefinite (unbounded) generator of
primes (because there are an infinite number of primes).

We could alter the meaning of primes to bound not the VALUE of the prime
produced, but to bound the NUMBER of primes produced. Here is the code for this
task

from predicate import is_prime
def primes(max_number_to_return = None):
    p = 2
    while max_number_to_return == None or max_number_to_return > 0:
        if is_prime(p):
            if max_number_to_return != None:
                max_number_to_return -= 1
            yield p
        p += 1 

for i in primes(20):
    print(i,end=' ')

This script produces not primes up to 20, but 20 primes. When run it prints

  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71

Note that we could have also written this primes function to create a finite
list of max_to_return primes and return that list, which the for loop above
could iterate over. But the advantage of the generator above is two-fold: it
can produce an infinite number of primes (not useful in the loop above but
useful in other examples), and the space it occupies is fixed (always a few
local names, none of which bind to a complicated data structure:
tuple/list/set/dict) no matter how many primes it must generate (unlike a
primes function that returns a list, whose space would grow with the value of
its parameters). Generators commmonly have this "can be infinite" and "use
fixed space" properties, when compared to function that return many values all
at once (e.g., puttig all the values in a list).

That finishes our discussion of generators unto themselves. The next sections
discuss how to use generators to implement the __iter__/__next__ protocol of
iterators for classes, and how to write iterator decorators.

<a name="iter"><h1>Generators for implementing __iter__/__next__ in classes</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In the previous lecture, I wrote the __iter__ method as follows. I could have
just returned iter(list(self.histogram)) using the standard list iterator, but
I wanted to show how to write an iterator that did its own indexing of the list
(as the list iterator actually, does, to show you how to do it).

    # standard __iter__: defines a class with __init__/__next__ and returns
    #   an object from that class
    def __iter__(self):
        class PH_iter:
            def __init__(self,histogram):
	        # copy so iteration not affected by mutation
                self.histogram = list(histogram)
                self.next = 0
            def __next__(self):
                if self.next == 10:
                    raise StopIteration
                answer = self.histogram[self.next]
                self.next += 1
                return answer

        return PH_iter(self.histogram)
 
Using generators, we can rewrite this method much more simply. First we will
use a class function _gen (the leading _ indicates that this is a helper method
in the class and only methods inside the class (like the __iter__ method)
should call it. It still uses indexes to iterate over the list; it still does
not use the list iterator.

    @staticmethod
    def _gen(bins)
        for i in range(10):
            yield bins[i]
                
    def __iter__(self):
        # copy so iteration not affected by mutation (e.g., clear/tally method)
        return Percent_Histogram._gen(list(self.histogram))

Similarly to how we defined a class in __iter__ we can define the gen generator
inside __iter__ as well; hiding this helper inside __iter__ makes is more
difficult to ever call it outside of __iter__, so I'm now calling it just gen.

    def __iter__(self):
        def gen(bins):
            for i in range(10):
                yield bins[i]
                
        # copy so iteration not affected by mutation (e.g., clear/tally method)
        return gen(list(self.histogram))

In fact, we can further simplfy this code to just a single method, which uses a
local variable to store a copy of the histogram list.

    def __iter__(self):
         hist_copy = list(self.histogram)
         for i in range(10):
            yield hist_copy[i]

__iter__ itself now becomes a generator itself. Calling it (as with any
generator) prepares it to be called by next in the future, to yield its values.

There is a subtle difference; the copy in the return gen(...) code is made
when the ITERATOR IS CALLED. The copy in the code directly above is made when
next() IS CALLED THE FIRST TIME. Recall that executing a method call to
__iter__ suspends as soon as it is called, and is executed only when next is
called on the suspended generator.
                
As a final simplification, if we want to iterate over the histogram (and not a
copy), we can write simply

    def __iter__(self):
         for i in range(10):
            yield self.histogram[i]
 
which is the same: it doesn't copy self.histogram, but uses it directly.

<a name="important"><h1>Important Tip!!</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
IMPORTANT HINT for writing Generators:

To those new to writing generators: if you want a GENERATOR to GENERATE a
sequence of values, write a FUNCTION that simply PRINTS that same sequence of
values. Then change every PRINT statement to a YIELD statement.

Using this idea makes generators easier to write and debug.
</pre>
<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="decorators"><h1>Iterable Decorators: Generators (iterable) that use Iterable Arguments</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In the previous lecture I wrote a few classes that implemented decorators for
iterables, each of which took an iterable argument (and possibly some other
arguments) and resulted in an object that was iterable.

These classes were not huge (about a dozen lines: __init__, __iter__, and inside
__iter__ an embedded class with __next__: that is a lot of infrastructure), but
each can be written almost trivially using generators (just a few lines, and
much simpler to understand code: not split across interconnected __init__,
__iter__, and __next__ methods).

Note the term decorator means that the thing created is the same type of thing
that is its argument (but decorated: with a change in behavior). So all these
generators take iterable as an argument, and because they are generators they
are iterable themselves: they iterate in a slightly different way than their
parameter, decorating it. Therefore we can compose iterable on top of iterable
on top of iterable (see the last example in this section).

Here are the classes from the previous lecture rewritten as generators, and
dramatically simplfied.

1) Repeatedly produce values from an iterable (over and over again)

def repeat(iterable):
    while True:
        for i in iterable:
            yield i

Again, the way to understand this generator is to think about what it would
print if the generator were changed to a function that printed i instead of
yielding it: it would repeatedly print everything in the iterable. Understand
the other generators (below) using the same idea.

Every time the inner for-loop finishes, it is restarted by the outside while
loop. I generalized this generator as follows, allowing a limit to the
repetitions, with the default None (which operates like repeat above).

def repeat(iterable,max_times=None):
    while max_times == None or max_times > 0:
        for i in iterable:
            yield i
        if max_times != None:
            max_times -= 1


2) Produce unique values (never the same one twice)

def unique(iterable):
    iterated = set()
    for i in iterable:
        if i not in iterated:
            iterated.add(i)
            yield i

Here the iterated set remembers every value yielded: only values not appearing
in this set are yielded. I generalized this generator as follows, allowing a
value to be repeated a certain number of times (with a default of 1, which
operates like unique above).

from collections import defaultdict  

def unique(iterable,max_times=1):
    times = defaultdict(int)
    for i in iterable:
        if times[i] < max_times:
            times[i] += 1
            yield i

This generator uses a defaultdict to remember how many times a value has been
yielded, ensuring that is is skipped (not yielded) if it has been yielded over
the maximum allowed number of times.


3) Filter an iterable, producing only values for which predicate p returns True
(called pfilter because there is a filter function supplied in itertools).

def pfilter(iterable,p):
    for i in iterable:
        if p(i):
            yield i


So writing 

  for i in pfilter(primes(1000), lambda x: x%10 == 3):
      print(i)

would print all the primes <= 1000 which end in the digit 3: 3, 13, 23, 43,
53, 73, 83, 103, 113, ...


4) The enumerate generator: how to write this Python built-in function

def enumerate(iterable,counter=0):
    for value in iterable:
        yield (counter, value)
        counter += 1


5) Produce values in a sorted sequence, according to key/reverse
(called gen_sorted because there is a sorted function that returns
a list of all the values gen_sorted yields).

def gen_sorted(iterable,key=None,reverse=False):
    l = list(iterable)
    l.sort(key=key,reverse=reverse)
    for i in l:
        yield i

By making a local copy of the list, we can sort it without mutating the list
passed as an argument.

We can easily test generators on strings, which are iterable (returning the
individual characters). E.g., the following example print only the vowels, in
sorted order, uniquely, that are in my name:

for i in pfilter(gen_sorted(unique('richardepattis')), lambda x : x in 'aeiou'):
    print(i,end='')

Let's now return to the original primes generator at the start of this lecture.
We now have some tools that we can use to simplify (actually avoid) this
generator. The general component below generates a sequence of integers, either
bound or unbounded (unlike range, which is always bounded). 

def ints(start,max = None, step = 1):
    i = start
    while max == None or (step >= 1 and i < max) or (step <= -1 and i > max):
        yield i
        i += step

Now, instead of calling primes we would call pfilter(ints(2),is_prime) to
represent the same iterator. And if we defined any other predicates, we could
supply them to pfilter to generate only values that satisfied those predicates.

Python has a module called itertools (see the library documentation) which
define many iterator decorators, whose composition allows for powerful
iteration in Python. We will return to using the itertools module later in
the quarter.

<a name="space"><h1>Space Efficiency</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Note that generators embody a small amount of code and often don't store any
large data structures (unique and gen_sorted above uses extra space in a
set/dict and list). Generators store/produce one value at a time, unlike, say,
most comprehensions, which produces an entire list/set/dict of values that must
all be stored at the same time; but like tuple comprehensions, which we saw are
a bit different.

-----
Recall, tuple comprehensions in Python produce generators. Try

  a = (i for i in range(10))
  print(a)
  t1 = tuple(a)
  print(t1)
  t2 = tuple(a)
  print(t2)

  l = [i for i in range(10)]
  print(l)
----

So when writing generators, we should always try to avoid storing a large
number of values in a data structure. It might make writing the generator more
difficult, but few generators need to store large amounts of data to work
correctly.

But, for some applicaitons (like reversed and sorted), Python must look at all
the iterated values before deciding what to yield first, so they typically work
by first storing all the values iterated over in some data structure (a tuple or
list: see gen_sorted above and gen_reversed below and then process values in the
tuple/list) which we hope is not huge.

from goody import irange

def gen_reversed(iterable):
    l = list(iterable)
    for i in irange(len(l)-1,0,-1):
        yield l[i]

In fact, there is a way to generate reversed values without ever storing
the iterable in a list! But the time is takes (in its doubly nested loop) can
be huge; so for choosing the implementation we want, we have to make a
choice whether time or space is more important: maybe we should define two
generators: reversed_save_time (same as gen_reversed) and reversed_save_space
(defined below)

def reversed_save_space(iterable):
    # compute the length of the iterable
    length = 0;
    for i in iterable:
        length += 1

    for c in range(length):
        # find the value at index (length-c) by restarting the iterable,
        #   then skipping length-c-1 values, and yielding the next value
        temp = iter(iterable)
        for i in range(length-c-1):
            next(temp)               # call next, but don't remember value
        yield next(temp)
        
While this seems very fast for small lists it can very run slowly for large
lists, because it is repeatedly skipping large numbers of values in the inner
loop for each single yield in the outer loop. For a list with 1,000 values, it
goes through all to find the length, then 999 to yield the value at the end,
then 998 to yield the value two from the end, then 997 to yield the value three
from the end... Compare running

for i in reversed_save_space([i for i in range(100000000)]):
    print(i)

against

for i in preversed([i for i in range(100000000)]):
    print(i)

On my computer, the fomer took about 10 second to generate each value, while
the later ran out of space. For smaller ranges (which fit in memory) the latter
fit in memory and ran much faster. Experiment.

<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Define a generator named match_indexes that takes a pattern string and a
text string as parameters. It yields every index in text which matches
pattern (compare the pattern to a slice in the tet). For example.

for i in match_indexes ('ab','aabbaabacab'):
    print(i,end='')

prints: 1 5 9

Upgrade your match_indexes generator to match a pattern string that is a
regular expression.

2) Using a generator executing a while loop, rewrite the prange_iterator
similarly to how the Percent_Histogram iterator was writen above.

3) Define a decorator for iterables  named take_starting using at generator;
it takes an iterable and predicate as arguments, and produces all values in
the iterator starting with the first one for which the predicate is true.

4) Define a decorator for iterables named product using a generator; it
takes two iterables as arguments, and produces all tuples with one value
taken from the first iterable and one taken from the second. For example, if
we wanted to generate a hand of playing cards (a list of 2-tuples, whose
first values are 1-13 (for ace-king) and whose second values are a suit (either
'H', 'C', 'D', or 'S' for heart, club diamond, or spade) we could call
product(irange(1,13),'HCDS') to produce this list.

5) Define a decorator for iterables named transform using a generator; it
takes an iterable and a function (whose domain is the iterable) as arguments,
and produces a transformed value for each value the iterable produces by
calling the function.
