<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In the two previous lectures we learned about complexity classes and how to
analyze algorithms (mostly Python statements/functions) to find their complexity
classes. These analyses were done by just looking at code (aka "static analyis")
and were independent of any technology: i.e., independent of which Python
interpreters we used and the speed of the computers running our code.

Given the complexity class of a runnable Python function, we can approximate
its running time by the function T(N) = c*complexity(N), where complexity(N)
is its complexity class: e.g., N, N Log N, N**2, etc. We can then run this
function on a reasonably-sized problem (with N not too small, so the discarded
lower-order terms are small enough to really ignore) and measure the amount of
time it takes (T). Finally, we can solve for the constant in the time equation:
c = T/complexity(N) by plugging in T and N. Then, we can use the formula
T(N) = c*complexity(N), with the computed c, to approximate the amount of time
this function requires to solve a problem of any size N. Such analysis (by
running code) is called "dynamic analysis".

In the first part of this lecture we will examine how to time functions on the
computer (rather than using a physical timer) and we will write some Python code
to help automate this task. Given such tools, and the ability to chart the time
required for various-sized problems, we can also use this data to infer the
complexity class of a function without ever seeing its code. Yet we can still
develop a formula T(N) to approximate the amount of time this function requires
to solve a problem of any size N, without even looking at the code.

Generally in this lecture we will explore using the computer (dynamic analysis)
to better help us understand the behavior of algorithms that might be too
complex for us to understand by static analysis (we might not even have the
algorithm in the form of code that we can examine, only run).

In the second section, we will switch scale and use a Profiling module/tool
named cProfile (and its associated module pstats) to run programs and determine
which functions are consuming the most time. Once we know this, we will an
attempt to improve the performance of the program by optimizing only those
functions that are taking significant time.

Finally, in the third section we will explore how Python uses hashing in sets,
frozen sets, and dicts to achieve a constant time complexity class, O(1) for
many operations. We will close the loop by using dynamic analysis to verify
this O(1) complexity class. Hashing is more closely studied in ICS-46.

<a name="understand"><h1>Understanding Sorting and N Log N Algorithms</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We previous discussed that the fastest algorithm for sorting a list is in the
complexity class O(N Log N). This is true not only for the actual algorithm
used in the Python sort method (operating on lists), but for for all possible
algorithms. In this section, without using this knowledge, we will time the
sorting function and infer its complexity class. In the process we will build
a sophisticated timing tool for timing sorting and other algorithms (and use
it a few times later in this lecture).

Here are Python statements that generate a list of a millon integers, shuffle
them into a random order, and then sort them.

alist = [i for i in range(1000000)]
random.shuffle(alist)
alist.sort()

Let's first discuss how to time this code. There is a time module in Python that
supplies access to various system clocks and conversions among various time
formats. I have written a Stopwatch class (in the stopwatch.py module, which is
part of courselib) that makes clocks much easier to use. The four main methods
for objects constructed from Stopwatch classes are start, stop, read, and reset.

You can read the complete documentation for this class by following the "Course
Library Reference" link and then clicking the Stopwatch link. The code itself
(if you are interested in reading it) is accessible in Eclipse by disclosing
the python.exe in the "PyDev Package Explorer", then disclosing "System Libs"
and then "workspace/courselib", and finally clicking on stopwatch.py to see
the code.

Here is a complete script that uses a Stopwatch to time only the alist.sort()
part of the code above. Notice that it imports the gc (garbage collection)
module to turn off garbage collection during the timing, so this process will
not interfere with our measurements. We need to turn it back on afterwards.

----------

Objects, Memory, and Garbage (collection)

When we construct an object in Python, we allocate part of the computer's memory
to store the object's state. The following loop will eventually consume all the
memory Python can use (it runs for a few seconds on my computer). It tries to
store a million factorials in a list: ultimately it raises a MemoryError
exception.

from goody import irange
facts = []
answer = 1
for i in irange(1,1000000):
  answer *= i
  facts.append(answer)
  
Garbage is objects constructed by Python, which can no longer be referred to.
If we wrote x = [i for i in range(1000000)] then x would refer to a list object
that stored a huge amount of memory. If we then wrote x = 1 the list object that
x used to refer to would become garbage (because x no longers refers to this
object and there are no other names through which to reach this object. If we
had instead written

x = [i for i in range(1000000)]
y = [0, 1, 2, x]
x = 1

Now, the object x formerly referred to can be referred to by y[3] so it is not
garbage.

Garbage collection is a way for the computer to find/reclaim memory that is
garbage. Typically Python allocates memory for objects until it finds it has no
more memory to allocate; then it does garbage collection to try to find more.

If it succeeds this process continues until it runs out of memory again, and
then repeats. If it ever cannot find enough free memory to allocate an object,
even after garbage collection (as in the first example) it raises an exception.
Finally, there are ways to tell Python how much of the computer's memory it can
use to allocate the objects it constructs. You will learn more about garbage
and garbage collection in ICS-45C (using C++, a language that does not have
automatic garbage collection) and ICS-46.

import random,gc
from stopwatch import Stopwatch

#setup
alist = [i for i in range(1000000)]
random.shuffle(alist)
s = Stopwatch()
gc.disable()

#timing
s.start()
alist.sort()
s.stop()

#results
print('Time =',s.read())
gc.enable()

We would like to develop a Performance tool that minimizes what we have to do
to time the code: a tool that also gives us interesting information about the
timing. The tool I developed for this lecture is based on the timeit.py module
supplied with Python (see secton 27.5 in the standard library documentation).
First, we show an example use of the tool, then its code. Here is the entire
script that uses the tool.

alist = [i for i in range(100000)]
p = Performance(lambda:alist.sort(), lambda:random.shuffle(alist),100,'Sorting')
p.evaluate()
p.analyze()

It first creates a list of 100,000 numbers. Then it constructs a performance
object with 4 arguments

(1) A parameterless lambda of the code to execute and time
(2) A parameterless lambda of the setup code to execute (but not time) before
       each (1) lambda is called
(3) The number of times to measure the code's execution: step 2 followed by 1
(4) A title (printed in the analyze method)

The actual __init__ function for Performance looks like;

def __init__(self,code,setup=lambda:None,times_to_measure=5,title='Generic'):

So, in the above call we are timing a call to alist.sort(); before timing each
call it sets up (not part of the timing) with a call to random.shuffle(alist);
it will do 100 timings (of the setup/code); the title when information is
printed is Sorting.

Calling p.evaluate() does all the timings and collects the information. It
returns a 2-list: a 3-tuple of the (minimum time, average time, maximum time),
followed by a list of all the (100 in this case) timings. It also saves this
information as part of the state of the Performance object, and uses it for
analysis by the analyze function.

Calling p.analyze() prints the following result on my computer. It consists of
the title; the number of timings; the average time, the minimum time, the
maximum time, and the span (a simple approximation to clustering: (max-min)/avg;
and a histogram of the timings (how many fall in the range .0404-.0406 bin,
.0406-.0408, bin, etc.) with an 'A' at the top of the stars indicating the bin
for the average time. Notice that although the span says the range of values
was 5.9% of the average, we can see that most of the timings are clustered very
close to the average (which itself is near the minimum time).

4.25e-02<>4.28e-02[  1.0%]|
4.28e-02<>4.30e-02[  1.0%]|

Using this tool, I ran a series of sorting experiments doubling the length of
the list to sort each time. Here was the script:

    for i in irange(0,8)  :
        alist = [i for i in range(100000 * 2**i)]
        p = Performance(lambda : alist.sort(), lambda : random.shuffle(alist),10,'Sorting')
        p.evaluate()
        p.analyze()

The data produced is summarized as follows (the raw data appears at the end of
this document).

        N  |   Time | Ratio | Predicted | %Error
-----------+--------+-------+-----------+--------
   100,000 |  0.041 |       |   0.051	|    23
   200,000 |  0.088 |  2.1  |	0.107	|    22
   400,000 |  0.194 |  2.2  |	0.227	|    17
   800,000 |  0.440 |  2.3  |	0.478	|     9
 1,600,000 |  1.004 |  2.3  |	1.004	|     0  (predictions based on this run)
 3,200,000 |  2.291 |  2.3  |	2.105	|     8
 6,400,000 |  5.068 |  2.2  |	4.406	|    13
12,800,000 | 11.380 |  2.2  |	9.201   |    19
25,600,000 | 25.185 |  2.2  |  19.182   |    24
51,200,000 | 60.692 |  2.4  |  39.992   |    24

I sorted lists from 100 thousand to 51.2 million values, doubling the length
every time, whoses sizes are listed in the first column. The average times
(from 10 experiments each) are listed in the second column. I computed the
ratio of T(2N)/T(N) for each N (after the first) and the ratio was always bigger
than 2 by a small amount. This indicates that the complexity class is slightly
higher than just O(N). As we discussed, it is actually O(N Log N).

Using O(N Log N) as the complexity class and using N = 1,600,000 I solved for
the constant in the forumla T(N) = c * N Log N and got 3.04166E-08, so we can
approximate the time taken to sort as T(N) = 3.042 * N Log N. Given this
approximation, the next columns shows the times predicted for that size N,
and the percent error between the predicted and real time (which grows as
N gets farther away -in both directions- from 1,600,000). The errors are not
bad: even a 100% error means that we have still predicted the time within a 
factor of of 2.

Here is the actual code for the Performance class. You will see that although
the constructor specifies times_to_measure, we can omit/override this value
when calling evaluate() by passing the number of times to test the code.
Likewise with the title and the analyze method (which also allows specification
of the number of bins to use in the histogram of times created).

This class is in the performance.py module in the empirical project folder: a

importing this module wherever is code that you want to time.

<a name="random"><h1>Random Binary Search Trees: A Dynamic Analysis</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Let's empirically examine the heights of binary search trees constructed at
random: values are added into binary search trees in random orders. We know that
the maximum/worst-case height for a binary search tree with size N is N-1; the
minimum/best case is a height of Log N. We will write code below to perform a
specified number of experiments, each building a random binary search tree of a
specified size: for each experiment we will collect the height of the tree
produced and ultimately plot a histogram of all the heights.

To run these experiments, we need to access the TN class and the height, add,
and add_all functions, which are all written in the tree project folder
(examined when we discussed trees). I copied that code into the randomtrees.py
module, but we could have imported it.

Here is the code to prompt the user for the experiment and compute a histogram
of all the different tree heights.

import prompt,random,math
from goody import irange
from collections import defaultdict

experiments = prompt.for_int('Enter # of experiments to perform')
size        = prompt.for_int('Enter size of tree for each experiment')

hist  = defaultdict(int)
alist = [i for i in range(size)]

for exp in range(experiments):
    if exp % (experiments//100) == 0:
        print('Progress: {p:d}%'.format(p =int(exp/(experiments//100))))
    random.shuffle(alist)
    hist[ height(add_all(None,alist)) ] += 1

print_histogram('Binary Search Trees',hist)
print('\nminimum possible height =',math.ceil(math.log2(size)),'  maximum possible height =',size-1)

For 10,000 experiments run on binary search trees of size 1,000, this code
printed the following results (after computing for a few minutes). For a 1,000
node tree, the minimum possible height is 10 and the maxium possible height is
999. The heights recorded here are all between about 1.5 times the minimum and
about 3 times the minimum (which is true for much larger random binary search
trees as well; see the next analysis).

minimum possible height = 10   maximum possible height = 999

Note because the 16, 30, 31 bins are printed, they were not 0 (there were
randomly constructed trees with those heights), although they had so few trees
that their percentage (to one decimal place) is 0.

The print_histogram method called in the code above is shown below

def print_histogram(title,bins_dict):
    print(title)
    
    count = sum(bins_dict.values())
    min_bin = min(bins_dict.keys())
    max_bin = max(bins_dict.keys())
    max_for_scale = max(bins_dict.values())
    print('Analysis of {count:,} experiments'.format(count=count))
    
    w_sum = 0
    for i in bins_dict:
        w_sum += i*bins_dict[i]
    avg = w_sum/count
    
    print('\navg = {avg:.1f}  min = {min}  max = {max}\n'.format(avg=avg,min=min_bin,max=max_bin))
    for i in irange(min_bin,max_bin):
        pc = int(bins_dict[i]/max_for_scale*50)
        extra = 'A' if int(avg+.5) == i else ''
        print('{bin:4}[{count: 5.1f}%]|{stars}'.format(bin=i,count=bins_dict[i]/count*100,stars='*'*pc+extra))

The results below are for 10,000 experiments run on binary search trees of size
100,000. This code took about 5 hours to run. Notice too that almost all the
trees are between 2 and 3 times the minimum possible tree; none are near the
maximum of 99,9999.

<a name="profile"><h1>Profiling Programs: Performance Summary of all Functions at the Program Level</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Profilers are modules that run other modules and collect information about
their execution: typically information about how many times their functions are
called, and the time spent inside each function: both the individual time and
the cumulative time, which includes the amount of time spent in the functions
they call. For example, in

  def f(...):
    ...code 1
    g(...)
    ...code 2

The INDIVIDUAL time for f includes the amount of time spent in code 1 and
code 2; the CUMULATIVE time for f also includes the amount of time spent in
function g; of course g will have its own individual and cumulative times.

Such information is useful for focusing our attention on the functions taking a
significant amount of time, so that we can optimize/rewrite them in the hope
of significantly improving the speed of our entire program (and not wasting our
time optimizing/rewriting functions that do not significantly affect the running
time.

Although the programs we wrote this quarter were sophisticated, they ran on only
a small amount of data and executed quickly. The ideal program to profile is one
that uses a lot of data and takes a long time to run. In my ICS-31 class,
students wrote a program that performs shotgun assembly on DNA strands. The
program isn't huge (only about 50 lines of code), but in the largest problem
they solve, the input is 1,824 DNA fragments that are 50-100 bases long. My
solution program took almost about 1.5 minutes to run, before printing the
resulting 10,000 base DNA strand. 

This program is a module that defines functions followed by a script that calls
these functions. To run it using the profiler, we need to move the statements
in the script into their own function (which I called perform_task). Then, we 
add the following import at the top, and add the following function call at the
bottom to profile the function/program.

import cProfile

...all the functions in the module, including perform_task

cProfile.run('perform_task()')

When run, the DNA assembly program performs its job and produces the correct
output (and in the process, prints information into the console). Then the
profiler prints the following information in the console, which shows in the top
line that it profiled 234 million function calls over 107 seconds: so overall
Python called 2.19 million functions/second.

The data shown here (and all the data shown below later) is always sorted by
one of the headings. This data is sorted by the ASCII values in the strings
produced by filename:lineno (function). The columns (no matter how sorted)
represent

ncalls : the number of times the function was called

tottime: the total time spent in just that function, NOT INCLUDING the time
           spent in the other functions that it calls (although some built-in
           functions it calls cannot be timed separately)
         This as a bad name; I'd prefer individual time; but it is total time.

cumtime: the cumulative time spent in that function, INCLUDING the time spent
           in the other functions that it calls

  So, as illustrated above, if function f performed some computation and called
  function g, the tottime for f would NOT include the time spent in g, but the
  cumtime would include this time. So it should always be the case that tottime
  <= cummtime.

Examine the information shown below, but we will look at parts of it more
selectively soon. Note that the sum of all the tottime data is the running time,
but many cumtime data have the same value as the total running time (or close):
the <module>, exc, perform_task, and assemble all show a cumulative time equal
to the running time, because cumtime form them is counted in the functions they
call.

By calling cProfile.run('perform_task()','profile') we direct the run function
to not print its results on the console, but instead to write them into the file
named 'profile' (or any other file name we want to use). Then we can use the
pstats module, described below, to read this data file and print it in
simplified forms.

Here is a script that uses pstats to show just the top 10 lines of the data
above, when sorted by ncalls, cumtime, and tottime.

import pstats
p = pstats.Stats('profile')
# uncomment the line below to print all the the information above
#p.strip_dirs().sort_stats(-1).print_stats()
p.sort_stats('calls').print_stats(10)
p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)
p.sort_stats('time').print_stats(10)

As we can see directly from the information above, the most tottime is spent in
the overlaps function. It is very simple, so when I tried to write it another
way, I couldn't get any time improvement. So then I moved on to the max_overlap
function. The max_overlap function calls overlaps for each possible overlap
(based on lengths of the stands to match), so since the ratio of calls
(overlap calls/max_overlap calls) is about 42/1, the average possible strand
overlap is 42.

By numcalls  I realized from the place it was called (in choose) that I could
simplify max_overlaps to not compute the maximum overlap, but just find (and
immediately return) any overlap that exceeds a minimum specified in the choose
method. By changing this, the above profile turned into the following one.

I was able to decrease the run time by about 20 seconds (almost 20%). Although
exceeds_overlap (I changed the name from max_overlap) is called the same number
of times as before, it calls overlaps about 25% fewer times, saving 12 seconds;
and because it is called fewer times, exceed_max saves another 8 seconds over
max_overlap, which together accounts for the full 20 seconds.

In a large system with thousands of functions, it is a big win to use the
profiler to focus our attention on the important functions: the ones that take
a significant amount of time, and therefore the ones likely to cause major
decrease in the runtime if improved. A rule of thumb is 20% of the code accounts
for 80% of the execution time (some say 10%/90%, but the idea is the same). We
need to be able to focus on which small amount of code the program spends most
of its time in. In the code above, if by hard work I could make the bottom 28
functions run instantaneously and there would be at most a 6 second (7%)
speedup: why bother? Better to have that code written as clearly as possible,
since its execution accounts for so little time.

Finally, the complete specifications for cProfile and pstats are avilable in
the Python library documentation, under section 27. Debugging and Profiling,
and under 27.4: The Python Profilers.

<a name="hashing"><h1>Hashing: How Sets/Dicts are Faster than Lists for operations like in</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
When we examined the complexity classes of various operations/methods on the
list, set, and dict data-types/classes, we found that sets/dicts had many
methods that were O(1). We will briefly explain how this is accomplished, but a
fuller discussion will have to wait until ICS-46. First we will examine how
hashing works and then analyze the complexity class of operations using hashing.

Python defines a hash function that takes any object as an argument a produces
a "small" integer (sometimes positive, sometimes negative) whose magnitude is
32 or 64 bits (depending on which Python you use). How this value is computed
won't concern us now. But we are guaranteed (1) there is a fast way to compute
it, (2) within the same program, an object with unchanged state always computes
the same result for hashing, so immutable objects always compute the same result
for their hash function.

Each class in Python implements a __hash__ method, which is called by the hash
function in Python's builtins module. Small integers are their own hash: hash(1)
is 1; hash(1000000) is 1000000; but hash(1000000000000000000000000) is
1486940387. Even small strings have interesting hash values: hash('a') is
1186423063; hash('b') is 1561756564; hash('pattis') is -1650297348 (is your
name hashed positive or negative)? (BUT SEE IMPORTANT NOTE BELOW).

-----
Note that when we define our own classes, if we want them to be used in sets or
as the keys in dictionaries (things that are hashed), we must define a __hash__
method for that class (with only self as its parameter), and this method must
return an int. If we do not provide a __hash__ method and try to use objects
from that class in sets or as the keys of dictionaries, Python will raise a
TypeError with the message: "unhashable type".

Technically, classes that contain mutator methods should NOT be hashable, but
it is OK to define __hash__ for a class of mutable objects: but if we do so, we
must NEVER mutate an object while it is in a set or the key of dictionary:
otherwise the object might be "lost" because it is in the wrong bucket (see
below). If we want to mutate such an object, we should remove it from the set
or dict, mutate it, and then put it back in: all these operations are O(1).

Again details about hashing is covered in much more detail in ICS-46.
-----

Let's investigate how to use hashing and lists to implement pset (pseudo set)
with a quick way to add/remove values, and check if a values is in the set: all
are in complexity class O(1).

We define the class pset (and its __init__) as follows. Notice the _bins is
a list of lists (starting with just 1 inner list, which is empty). The __str__
method prints these bins.

Objects in this class use _len to cache the number of values in their sets:
incrementing it when adding values and decrementing when removing values. The
last parameter specifies the load factor threshold, which we will discuss when
we examine the add method. Notice that the first parameter, iterable, is
anything we can iterate over, adding each value to the set to initialize it.

class pset:
    def __init__(self,iterable=[],load_factor_threshold=1):
        self._bins = [[]]
        self._len  = 0      # cache, so don't have to recompute from bins
        self._lft  = load_factor_threshold
        for v in iterable:
            self.add(v)

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self._bins)
    
Recall that _bins will store a list of lists (which we call a hash table). Each
inner list is called a bin. Hash tables grow as we add values to them (just how
they grow is the secret of the O(1) performance). Before discussing the add
method, let's observe what _bins looks like as values are added.

The load factor of a hash table is the number of values in the table divided by
the number of bins (inner lists). As we add values to the bins, this number
increases. Whenever this value exceeds the load factor threshold the number of
bins is doubled, and all the values that were in the original bins are put back
into the new bins (we will see why their positions often change). Such an
operation is called rehashing. By increasing the number of bins, it will lower
the load factor (by increasing its denominator) below the threshold.

0) start  : [[]]
1) add 'a': [['a']]
2) add 'b': [['b'], ['a']]
3) add 'c': [['b'], [], [], ['a', 'c']]
4) add 'd': [['b'], [], ['d'], ['a', 'c']]
5) add 'e': [[], [], [], ['c'], ['b'], ['e'], ['d'], ['a']]
6) add 'f': [['f'], [], [], ['c'], ['b'], ['e'], ['d'], ['a']]
7) add 'g': [['f'], [], [], ['c'], ['b'], ['e'], ['d'], ['a', 'g']]
8) add 'h': [['f'], [], ['h'], ['c'], ['b'], ['e'], ['d'], ['a', 'g']]

Recall Load Factor = # values in the table/# of bins in the table

0) At the start, 1 bin with no values so the load factor is 0.
1) We add 'a' to the first bin in the _bins list; the load factor 1
2) We add 'b' to the first bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 2, which
      exceeds the threshold so all the values are rehashed as shown, and
      the load factor is now 2/2.
3) We add 'c' to a bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 3/2, which exceeds
      the threshold so all the values are rehashed (notice that 'a' and
      'c' are both in the same bin; this is called a collision and often
      happens when there are many values in hash tables)
4) We add 'd' to the third bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 4/4.
5) We add 'e' to one bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 5/4, which
      exceeds the threshold so all the values are rehashed (notice all the
      values are in their own bins now), and the load factor is now 5/8.
6) We add 'f' to the first bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 6/8.
7) We add 'g' to the last bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 7/8.
8) We add 'h' to the third bin in the _bins list; the load factor is 8/8.
(adding another value will double the number of bins)

Now lets look at the _bin helper method, which finds the bin for the value:
if the value is in the pset, it must be in that bin (although this calculation
changes if the length of _bins changes, which is why rehashing is necessary); if
the value is to be added to a pset, that is the bin it belongs in.

    def _bin(self,v):
        return abs(hash(v))%len(self._bins)

It hashes the value, computes its absolute value, and then computes its
remainder when divided by the number of bins; so the index it produces is
always between 0 and len(self._bins)-1, is always a legal index for the _bins
list. This is the bin the value belongs in WHEN THE HASH TABLE IS THAT LENGTH:
if its length changes, the denominator in the calculation above also changes, so
the bin it belongs in might change too. 

The code for add is as follows:

    def add(self,v):
        index = self._bin(v)
        if v in self._bins[index]:
            return
        
        self._len += 1
        self._bins[index].append(v)
        if self._len/len(self._bins) > self._lft:
            self._rehash()

It first computes the bin in which the value v must be in (if it is in the hash
table) and then checks if it is there; if so it returns immediately because
sets have just one copy of a value. Otherwise, it increments _len and appends
the value v into the bin in which it belongs. But if the newly added value
makes the load factor exceeed the threshold all the values are rehashed in the
following helper method. The _rehash helper method is only called from add

   def _rehash(self):
        old       = self._bins
        #double the number of bins (to drop the load_factor_threshold)
        #rehash old values: len(self._bins) has changed
        self._bins = [[] for i in range(2*len(old))]
        self._len = 0
        for bins in old:
            for v in bins:
                self.add(v)
  
This method remembers the old bins, resets the _bins and _len, and then adds
each value v from the old bins into the new bins; its bin number might change
because the % function calculated in _bin. By doubling the number of bins, there
will be no calls to _rehash while all these values are added.

Checking whether a value v is in a pset is simple: it just checks whether v is
in the bin/list hashing says it belongs in.

    def __contains__(self,v):
        return v in self._bins[self._bin(v)]

Likewise, removal goes to the bin the value v would be in IF it were in the
pset, and if it is there it is removed and the cached length is decremented; if
not in this bin, no others need to be checked no changes are made to th pset.

    def remove (self,v):
        index = self._bin(v)
        for i in range(len(self._bins[index])):
            if self._bins[index][i] == v:
                del self._bins[index][i]
                self._len -= 1
                return

Finally, we can show the trivial __len__ function, returning the cached values
(incremented in add and decrmented in remove):

    def __len__(self):
        return self._len  # cached

So, why are the add, contains, and remove methods O(1)?

Because the hash function does a good job of randomizing in which bins values
are stored, and the load factor is kept around 1 (meaning there are about as
many bins as values: as more and more values are added, the length of the list
of bins grows), the amount of time it takes to add/examine/remove a value from a
its bin in hash table (as used in pset) is constant. That is, if there are N
values in the pset, there are at lease N bins, and the average number of values
in a bin is close to 1.

It takes a constant amount of work (independent from the number of values in the
hash table) to hash a value to find its bin, and since each bin has about 1
value in it, it takes a constant amount of time to check or update that bin.

Now, some bins are empty and some can have more than one value (but very few
have a lot of values). I added an analyze method to pset so that it can show
statistics about the number of bins and their lengths.

If we call the following function as experiment(1000000), it generates 1 million
random 26 letter strings and puts them in a hash table, whose size grows from 1
to 2**20 (which is a bit over a million)

    def build_set(n,m=26):
        s = pset()
        word = list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:m])
        for i in range(n):
            random.shuffle(word)
            s.add(''.join(word))
        return s
    
    def experiment(n,m=26):
        s = build_set(n,m)
        s.analyze()
 
We can call this function to analyze the distribution of values in bins. Here
is one result produced by calling experiment witht the argument 1 million
(whose output text is reduced a bit to fit nicely on one page).

bins with  0 values = 601,942 totaling        0 values; cumulative =         0
bins with  1 values = 148,927 totaling  148,927 values; cumulative =   148,927
bins with  2 values = 141,393 totaling  282,786 values; cumulative =   431,713
bins with  3 values =  90,011 totaling  270,033 values; cumulative =   701,746
bins with  4 values =  42,720 totaling  170,880 values; cumulative =   872,626
bins with  5 values =  16,507 totaling   82,535 values; cumulative =   955,161
bins with  6 values =   5,226 totaling   31,356 values; cumulative =   986,517
bins with  7 values =   1,411 totaling    9,877 values; cumulative =   996,394
bins with  8 values =     363 totaling    2,904 values; cumulative =   999,298
bins with  9 values =      59 totaling      531 values; cumulative =   999,829
bins with 10 values =      16 totaling      160 values; cumulative =   999,989
bins with 11 values =       1 totaling       11 values; cumulative = 1,000,000

As you can see, most bins store no values! But many other bins store just a few
values; in fact the bins storing 1-5 values account for over 95% of the values
in the hash table. So for almost 96% of the values in the hash table, it takes
at most 5 comparisons to examine/update these bin, and 5 is a constant.

Now we can close the circle started in this lecture by using Performance to
empirically analyze whether all our conjectures about the performance of hash
tables are correct. We will construct psets with different numbers of values,
doubling each time. We test each pset by adding N values and then performing N
lookups. If each of these operations is truly O(1) and we do N of each, the
complexity class of doing both it O(N), so doubling N should double the time.

The data shows this behavior exactly, with much less error than our sorting
analysis.

     N  |   Time  |  Ratio  |  Predicted  |  %Error
--------+---------+---------+-------------+----------
  1,000	|  0.030  |         |   0.030          0
  2,000 |  0.060  |    2.0  |   0.060     |    0
  4,000 |  0.120  |    2.0  |   0.120     |    0
  8,000 |  0.240  |    2.0  |   0.241     |    0
 16,000 |  0.481  |    2.0  |   0.481     |    0 (predictions based on this run)
 32,000 |  0.962  |    2.0  |   0.962     |    0
 64,000 |  1.927  |    2.0  |   1.924     |    0
128,000 |  3.873  |    2.0  |   3.848     |    1
256,000 |  7.735  |    2.0  |   7.696     |    1

All this code is in the hashing.py module in the empirical project folder: a
download that accompanies this lecture. So, you can run your own experiments.

------------------------------
IMPORTANT:

For some screwy reason whenever I am in a certain program, Python gives me
exactly the same value when hashing a string; but when I stop the program and
start a new one, it gives a different values (but always the same one for that
run of the interpreter). That makes things much harder to explain. I think the
hashing function uses some property of running the program (say the time it
is started) in the hash function. This is good for exposing errors in code that
uses hashing, but not so good for being able to show examples.

This is also why different runs of exactly the same program with exactly the
same data will produce different iteration orders for set.
------------------------------

Here are the methods that implement iteration for psets. The order that the
values in the pset are produced is: all those value (in order) in the list in
bin 0, all those values (in order) in the list in bin 1, etc.

    def __iter__(self):
        for b in self._bins:
            for v in b:
                yield v

Recall that the values moved around when rehashed. So that is why there is no
simple order in the sets/dicts we iterate over.

Finally, we have discussed that set and dictionary keys cannot be mutable. Now
we can get some insight why. If we put a value in its bin, but then change its
state (mutate it), the hash function would compute a different result and _bin
would probably want it in a different bin. And if it is in the wrong bin,
looking for it, or trying to remove it, or trying to add it (with no duplicates)
will not work correctly.
